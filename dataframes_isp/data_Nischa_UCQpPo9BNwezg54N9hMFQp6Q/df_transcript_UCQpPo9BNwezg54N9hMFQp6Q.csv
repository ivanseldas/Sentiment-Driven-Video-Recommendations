1b4nPw2XCCs,"here are four non-finance books that
changed my life and made me rich in
terms of relationships health and
overall happiness number one How to Win
Friends and Influence People one of the
first self-development books I read was
this book by Dell Carnegie it's nearly
100 years old now published in 1937 I
read back on it recently and now some of
it feels like common sense but at the
time it was all new I didn't know most
of the things so if you haven't read it
this is a classic text which is a
Cornerstone for developing better social
skills and being able to speak to anyone
easily or for even overall just being a
nicer person the biggest takeaway from
this book is a to be interested not
interesting simple things like smiling
asking people about themselves
discussing their interests these are all
things that make you likable not in a
scammy way but in a sincere genuine way
some of the book's most impactful
lessons include firstly become genuinely
curious about other people and their
lives secondly remember that a person's
name their own name is the sweetest
sound they could hear and bring it up in
a conversation use it in a conversation
number three frame conversations around
the other person's interests not just
your own and number four make those
around you feel significant and
appreciated as Carnegie summarizes you
can make more friends in two months by
becoming interested in other people than
you can in 2 years by trying to get
other people interested in you really
good book number two we then have a
break beh habit of Being Yourself by Joe
dispenser I read this book when I was
stuck with where I wanted to go I knew I
wanted to get more out of life I knew I
wanted to do more achieve more and I
felt like I was putting the work in but
I wasn't seeing the results and it was a
close friend that recommended this to me
and it's played a huge role in me being
able to break through to create a life
that I never believed I was capable of
and that I wouldn't have been able to
achieve with my previous mindset it's a
long book there's a lot of detail in it
some of it went over my head but what I
like is that it's not fluffy it's based
on neuroscience and quantum physics with
spirituality mixed into it dispenser
basically explains how we have a
subconscious mind and a conscious mind
our conscious mind is think of it as a
tip of the iceberg so these are things
that you're thinking whilst you're
watching this video the things that
you're doing at the moment that's all
your conscious mind the other 90% lies
in the subconscious mind and the
subconscious mind is a vast repository
of our thoughts of our feelings our
behaviors and it's that subconscious
that is the driving force behind so much
of what we do the way we think and who
we are fundamentally as a person when
you have a thought or a feeling there's
certain urance in your brain that fires
electrical signals and the more often
these neurons fire at the same time the
more likely they are to fire at the same
time again in the future so when you
frequently think or feel something you
repeatedly activate the same neurons in
your brain and over time you strengthen
those connections making those thoughts
or those feelings a habit for yourself
so this book talks about how to rewire
your brain and Forge New connections it
talks about how to reinvent yourself
using science it's a bit on the dense
bgs but the overall takeaways for me
have been life-changing whenever I read
a good book I have this sudden urge to
want to do more whether it's to do more
in the business to be more productive to
start a new project and I have this new
idea and I'm looking to learn more about
it I check out the classes on skillshare

number three the three
marriages this book it really had me
rethinking my entire approach to life
this book talks about how we have three
marriages not just one one two are
significant other one is our commitment
to work and one is our commitment to our
inner selves as someone who was
constantly trying to balance work love
and self this book has been
revolutionary I used to think I had to
compartmentalize these three areas of my
life I had to devote X hours to the job
Y hours to my partner Z hours to myself
but the author made a really compelling
case that this work life balance
mentality is just way too simplistic
instead he argues that these three
marriages to our work to our loved ones
and to ourselves are all interconnected
and or interdependent they're not
separate domains but they should be
balanced instead they should support one
another and enhance one another and that
really hit home for me I realized I was
inadvertently pting these aspects of my
life against each other constantly
feeling like I had to sacrifice one to
serve another so the key takeaway that
changed everything was understanding
that true Harmony comes when you stop
trying to balance and you start focusing
on integration how can my work feed my
relationship how can my relationship
nourish my sense of self it's all about
finding those synergies instead of
seeing them as competing priorities the
real life stories and the author's
writing made it really really engaging
and relatable I found myself nodding
long and thinking y that's me in so many
instances so if you're feeling like
you're struggling with work life balance
this is you it will give you a whole new
approach for approaching work love and
self in a way that brings more
fulfillment more Harmony and more joy to
each of the areas and number four
surrounded by idiots have you ever found
yourself thinking you're communicating
really well really effectively you're
explaining things very simply you've
laid it out from a to zed but the other
person just can't understand or get what
you're trying to say I mean I'm sure
we've all felt like this this book goes
into the four key personality types and
the key personality types are
represented by color red yellow green
and blue and it talks about how
understanding the communication style of
each of these personalities can change
your relationship with them the key
takeaway from this book is that the same
words can have completely different
meanings for different personality types
so what's clear and logical to one
person may be completely confusing to
another simply because of their innate
personality differences so the author
offers practical tips on how to identify
the personality type of the person
you're communicating with and then
adjust your wording and your tone and
approach in a way that they could most
connect with biggest takeaway is to
learn to adapt to others communication
style rather than expecting them to
adapt to Yours by being flexible and
meeting people where they are you can
have more productive more collaborative
conversations and avoid the frustration
of feeling like you're surrounded by
idiots so those are four non Finance
books that I've Loved I'd love some
recommendations from you what are some
non-finance books that you recommend
that I and others should check out and
how have they helped you increase your
wealth in the different areas of your
life thanks for watching don't forget to

WOQL9S-CEHI,"hello and welcome back to the channel in
this video we're going to talk about
five Investments be it Time Investments
or money Investments that have massively
boosted my productivity and earning
potential first up we're going to start
with my trusty whiteboard this purchase
was made very shortly after reading the
book The 12we Year by Brian Morgan
really good book the author explains how
the main barriers that hold us back from
earning our worth isn't our lack of
knowledge it isn't our lack of skill it
isn't our lack of expertise that we tend
to think it is it's often our lack of
execution and I know this has definitely
been the case for me i' get stuck in the
planning and the analysis stage so often
overthinking things and then struggle to
take the necessary action steps I always
found that it was easier to stay in the
comfort zone of planning than to
actually execute on my ideas I knew what
I needed to do but I just kept finding
ways to avoid doing it so I bought a
whiteboard and on it I break down my
12we goal for the quarter into this
week's action steps and just by having
this up on my wall as I'm working having
this visual tangental representation of
my priorities and action steps and
seeing those tasks laid out in front of
me every single day as I work has made
me a lot more focused on the right
things and then at the end of the week I
review where I'm at tick things off and
then spend some time planning for the
next week and writing up the next week's
action plan I've just found that having
a whiteboard has really helped me
develop an execution mindset the
structure and the accountability that
has come from having a whiteboard has
definitely cut my project completion
time and there for increasing my hourly
rate that's the first purchase the next
one that's made a huge difference are 1
second are these headphones these were
around £220
$280 but After experiencing the power of
noise cancelling technology I'll never
be able to go back to regular earphones
I don't know how I spent so long without
having noise cancelling earphones and
the reason why these are so effective
well have you ever found yourself
turning off the radio when you're lost
or finding a hard to concentrate or read
something when someone around you or
next to you is talking really loudly it
wasn't until I started using these noise
cancelling headphones that I realized
how much all the background noise around
me was draining my cognitive resources
and my ability to focus when I put my
headphones on I just enter into this
peaceful distraction-free environment
that is in full Focus so and there's
some really interesting research on how
athletes use pre-performance routines to
help them get into a state of deep focus
for Optimal Performance for me putting
on these noise cancelling headphones is
like my own pre-work ritual most of the
time I don't even play any music through
them I just put them in turn my phone on
airplane mode close down all the tabs on
my laptop except for the one that I'm
working on and that's my routine and
I've noticed on the days that I don't do
one of those three steps my productivity
just plummets it takes me 5 hours to do
what it would take me otherwise 1 hour
to finish definitely definitely
recommend investing in noise cancelling
headphones if you haven't already number
three and this is more of a Time
investment than a money investment and
it's stacking old skills with new unique
skills increasing your skill set will
increase your pay but the math of skill
stacking is that you want 1+ 1 to equal
three so to explain using my own career
every time I made a p I've intentionally
tried to pair unique skills together so
I started in the corporate world in back
office within a bank crunching numbers
analyzing data I thought this would be a
solid career choice but I hated my role
so I stayed in the division just to
complete my accountancy qualification I
knew that would carry credit ability
later on and then I made a lateral move
into strategy there I learned how to
structure my ideas effectively learned
about front office products through
those skills I moved into front office
where I learned about communication the
art of persuasion and then my latest
career piver has allowed me to leverage
my entire skill stack from my corporate
career while adding new skills that
aren't usually paired with the existing
skills I had so skills like copywriting
how to communicate through social media
these are all together with the skills I
had a unique solution that has increased
my potential for earning even more skill
stacking is about drawing upon
everything you've learned to make
yourself a unique solution today this
doesn't diminish the importance of
specialist knowledge but the more skills
you can pair and the more unique those
pairings are the higher your earning
potential one of the most important
skills I believe everyone should have to
increase their earning potential is
curiosity being a constant learner will
keep you relevant and will help you
avoid career stagnancy and that is where
i' like to introduce today's sponsor

premium subscription number four my
bigger monitor I've always been used to
two or three screens in banking the
sales and trading floor had setups with
three screens and almost every other
division had at least two cognitive
science research shows that our brains
process information better when we can
view related content side by side we're
able to take in and break down
information from loads of sources
simultaneously when they're all within
our view and it allows us to make faster
connections spot patterns more easily
and switch between tasks a more easily
and with greater fluency research has
consistently shown that using multiple
screens can increase productivity by 20
to 50% compared to using just a single
screen and although I don't have a
triple monitor screen I don't think it's
necessary I found that just having a
single larger 27in display has allowed
me to easily view two windows side by
side I keep my research materials open
on one side and then I write and analyze
on the other without constantly having
to toggle between the tabs or Shuffle
Windows around the only cavier is that
you do need to make sure you have a big
enough desk to accommodate this larger
screen my previous desk was really
narrow so the screen was really close up
to my face and I have to keep turning
left and right to be able to see one
side of the screen and then another now
getting a bigger screen and a screen
that is big but not too big has made all
the difference in allowing me to take
full advantage of the bigger screen real
estate and number five tombstones in the
world of Finance we have something
called tombstones these are physical
glass or metal plaques that were awarded
when you closed a significant deal or
you achieved a major Milestone when
someone got a tombstone they put it on
their table they'll put it in the office
they'll post about it on LinkedIn they
would include it on their CV they would
make sure that that Tombstone was known
about and while we may not have literal
tombstones in our day-to-day lives we
can create our own digital tombstones to
build a strong personal brand and
thereby increasing our rate and earning
potential and it's very small things
that compounded add to your overall
value so posting on Linkin about events
you've organized or things that you've
LED outside of work sharing your work on
a personal website on a Blog on social
media channels participating as a
speaker or a panelist at industry events
as I've started accumulating more of
these digital tombstones so I've been
featured in Publications I do corporate
talks I have my professional
qualifications I always mention these
small tombstones that I'm adding to my
credentials list which have allowed me
to charge more and more or higher rates
for doing the same thing that I did for
far less a few years ago it's a
compounding effect the more tombstones
you can accumulate the more leverage you
have to command better opportunities and
a higher pay so those are fire

YuS8WpxiJb0,"for years I felt trapped on a Relentless
treadmill stuck in the grind working for
someone else and allowing my job to
Define my entire identity I have become
convinced that the only path to Freedom
was to quit the 95 Rat Race but after
spending so long working for an
organization and now also having seen
the other side and experienced what it's
like to work for yourself I've now
realized that the real issue wasn't my
job it was me and so in this video I
wanted to share some of the hidden
secrets that I've learned that can help
you break free and fully Thrive no
matter where you work number one realize
that you're not dependent on anyone when
I worked for an organization I remember
there was this one time where I was on a
team call and my boss my direct line
manager had a heated debate with someone
else in the organization and that
conversation became personal and after
the call he wanted me to send an email
to the other person he drafted it and it
was emotional it was rude but he didn't
want to be the person that it came from
and so I redrafted it and I told him I'm
happy to send it but it a watered down
version and it was more factual and he
looked at it and he said I have to use
the email that he drafted and his words
were I'm not asking you I'm telling you
those were his exact words and I
remember in that moment I felt so
stressed and pressured I felt like this
person had complete control over me that
if I didn't do as he said it would
impact my pay my promotion it would even
cost me my job but looking back I
realized that the real issue wasn't my
job or my boss it was my own mindset I
had created this narrative in my head
that I was trapped with no other options
and I was so attached to the security of
this paycheck that I was willing to
compromise my own values instead of
realizing all of the other options that
I actually had and I thank him now
because I get to share this story with
you and pass on what I've learned from
it which is no matter where you work
never believe that you are dependent on
any one thing or person but your current
situation is not the only option that
you have there are so many other paths
and other ways to create the life and
career that you want by the way if you
like these kind of videos where I talk
about what I've learned through my life
experiences and what I'm learning on a
daily basis and how that changes the
path or the way I navigate life going
forward then you'll enjoy my newsletter
I send it out whenever I learn something
new really every week every two weeks
and it's completely free the link is in
the description number two find your
Flow State there's this beautiful
concept from the book flow and I love
the philosophy behind this the author
explains that we are living in one of
two states one is when your challenge is
greater than your skill and when you're
in that state you're depressed you're
frustrated you're disappointed your
challenge is greater than your skill the
other State or the other category is
when your skill is greater than your
challenge when you're at this state you
feel lethargic you procrastinate you
become complacent and the people who I
found who I speak to who feel like they
have the most autonomy who feel like
they are at the happiness are sitting in
this perfect place of Flow State they
feel momentum they're thriving they're
in this state of flow where their skill
matches their Challenge and so often we
feel trapped purely because we've been
doing what we know how to do for too
long so even now if I only recorded
YouTube videos it wouldn't challenge me
anymore I've done it consistently for
almost 2 years but anytime I do
something bigger harder more scaled up
or that challenges me so I went live on
television for the first time last week
and that scared me a bit and it's those
moments that made me feel like I'm
growing you need a little bit of
discomfort to feel free so any given
time in your career ask yourself do you
need to improve your challenge or do you
need to improve your skill set if it's
your challenge are you going to increase
the scale of what you're doing the scope
your level of responsibility it doesn't
mean doing something completely new it
just may mean doing something with more
detail or something bigger the key is to
find that sweet spot where your skill
matches your challenge by the way
sometimes you might find something is
really out of your comfort zone or that
the skills required are far greater than
what you think you can achieve and one
thing you can do to close that Gap is to
see if there are any tools out there to
support you and that is where the
sponsor of today's video comes in and
that is grammarly I use Gramm almost
every day by default it's an AI writing
partner designed to help you write
better and faster and unlike any other
AI tool I've come across Grammy Works
where you work so you don't need to copy
and paste between platforms and that has
been a complete Game Changer the free
version checks your spelling and grammar
it offers you suggestions as you write
and it includes AI features and then the
premium version which is what I now pay
for also predicts what what questions a
reader would ask when reading your text
and then it helps you tailor your work
to fill in those gaps up front so
whether it's providing more context or
offering solutions to a problem it goes
above and beyond what you'd usually
think to write it spots the gaps in your
work it also has an app action function
which lets you focus on your work
without needing to switch between apps
so for example grabbing a Google Drive
Link for this important email without
even having to open a new window or tab
if you want to check out the features
I've just mentioned you can check
grammarly premium by signing up using
the link in the description number three
fill your free time with work this is a
really small mindset shift that
completely changed the way I now think
about work I used to think of work as
something that dictates my life it took
away from my ability to live the way I
wanted to because what I used to do is
carve out chunks of my tile work and
then I just leave my evenings and
weekends open and so inevitably those
evenings and weekends would be filled up
with more work because I had nothing
else planned and even when I wasn't
physically working I wouldn't be doing
anything else to distract me and so in
the back of my head I'll be thinking
about working then I thought what if I
flipped this the other way around so
instead of work being carved out first I
plan my life first and then work can
become the filler not the focus so since
the start of this year I've started to
plan my week ahead on Sundays and are
pre-commit it to activities like classes
social events reading or whatever and
then work would fill the gaps with
purpose and productivity so for instance
this week already I've got dinner
planned on Tuesday with a friend I've
got a sass of class on Thursday in the
evening I'm working from a new coffee
shop that I wanted to try out for a
while on Thursday afternoon and I've
booked in reforma Pilates during Friday
lunchtime and now all my work will fit
around this and I really recommend this
doing it on Sunday before your work week
starts pre-commit to activities for your
personal life and the things that really
bring you Joy this way work becomes what
you do in the slots that aren't already
filled with life next we have a
diversify your identity when we think of
Google a lot of us think that it's just
the world's biggest search engine but
when you actually look into what
Google's vision is is to organize the
world's information and make it
universally accessible and useful it's
so much more than a search engine which
lets Google Venture into various fields
from AI to self-driving cars same thing
with apple it started as a computer
company but the vision of Apple is to
bring the best user experience to its
customers through Innovative Hardware
software and services these huge
companies never tie themselves into
anyone label or tie themselves to the
thing that they started off with and it
gave them the freedom to explore so many
other things often we tie our entire
identity to one thing and that is
usually dictated around our job we think
that our job title defines everything we
can be or do and I've been there when I
worked in banking I saw myself solely as
a corporate professional my entire
identity was wrapped up in that role and
for a long time I didn't see myself as
doing anything else the idea of starting
something new felt impossible because I
confined myself to this narrow identity
of being a corporate girl and if you
label yourself too early and you pin
yourself to this identity that is based
on what you currently do it's very easy
to then trap yourself into thinking a
certain way and never giving yourself
the freedom to explore other areas that
interest you but you can be completely
different things you can be a painter
and a data analyst you can be a yoga
Enthusiast and a gamer you can be a
writer and a chef you can be an
accountant and a YouTuber so my advice
here is think about who you are beyond
your job title what passions or interest
can you explore to broaden your sense of
self in a way that doesn't make you feel
trapped to one identity and finally my
favorite number five there's so much
conditioning that we have to always be
nice and to tiptoe around other people's
opinions but sometimes a real way to
feel free and to not let work take full
control of your life is to not care
about what other people think and do
what is best for you for example say
someone at your company asks you to do
something that's a favor that's outside
of your job description it's not exactly
something that will help you get
promoted it will help you pay and it's
coming from someone who never does you
any favors or helps you out in return do
you do it well no you shouldn't and I'm
speaking from experience when I started
working at Deutsche Bank and I first
moved into front office I wanted to
please everyone and just do a good job
and I found it so hard to set boundaries
with other people in the team there was
another Junior person who' been working
in the team for longer than I had who'd
always ask me to stay back after she
left and do these admin tasks that she
didn't want to do these tasks didn't
give me any recognition or any Glory I
didn't benefit from them at all and the
first time she asked I did it as a favor
the second time I did it as a favor and
the third or fourth time I set my
boundaries in place because ultimately
your company will try to get as much out
of you as you can and you are the person
that needs to set these boundaries and
there's a famous quote by brune Brown
daring to set boundaries is about having
the courage to love ourselves even when
we risk disappointing others the reason
why I wanted to make this video is
because earlier in this year I had this
amazing sponsor approach me and they
were going to work with me for a huge
amount but the caveat was that they
would literally tell me what I had to
say and when I had to say it word for
word it wasn't coming from me and it
made me feel back to where I was 5 years
ago where my whole life was being
dictated by someone else and I felt like
I was being dependent on something else
I didn't have full control over what I
did and I didn't feel free and so if
you're not careful it doesn't matter
where you work it doesn't matter what
you do you can always end up not
realizing that you keep building a cage
around yourself that stops you from
having control over the decisions you
make quitting a 9 to5 isn't always an
option but the other things that I've
spoken about in this video setting
boundaries doing things outside of work
changing your mindset when it comes to
who owns you these are all things that
are fully within your control so I hope
that helps if you like this video you'll

QS-7ts4S8N8,"two signs that you're doing well
financially even if it doesn't feel like
it coming from a qualified accountant
and a former investment banker number
one you're focused on the wealth game
Society often measures success by the
status game the size of your house the
brand of your car the label on your
clothes but 40% of people don't have
enough money put away to support
themselves for one month in the absence
of work so if they lose their job one
month later they're insolvent if you're
looking at someone else feeling behind
financially because you don't own the
same things that they do remember wealth
is measured by the things you don't see
rather than things you do number two
comparing against the wrong people
studies show that someone whose Close
Associates earn 50,000 a year is going
to feel bad about their own finances if
they themselves earn 40,000 but that
same person will feel good about their
finances if their friends made not
50,000 but 30,000 a year the issue here
is that this is a NeverEnding cycle
there will always be someone making more
than you so remember finances is a
personal Journey not a race against
others"
mtXWm7GCn0w,"the goal is to grow your bank account
not your ego here's four reasons why
keeping a low profile can actually lead
to higher rewards number one it frees
you from the cycle of permanent
dissatisfaction think about your own
life every time you hit a milestone
whether it's getting a promotion buying
a nicer car moving into a better
neighborhood a new set of Standards
suddenly surrounds you it's like paying
a never-ending game where the rules keep
changing you buy a great car and for a
moment it feels amazing but then you
notice your friend's cars even better
and that initial Joy Fades this isn't
just a feeling it's backed by science
researchers call it the honic treadmill
and it's exactly what it sounds like
imagine you're on a treadmill at a gym
no matter how fast you run you stay in
the same spot relative to the room the
same thing happens with your happiness
no matter how much more money you make
or how many new things you buy your
overall happiness tends to stay the same
and there was a study that looked into
how people's happiness actually change
with their level of income and they
found that once we have enough money to
cover basic needs like our food shelter
Healthcare having more money doesn't
make us a lot more happier we quickly
adapt to our new level of wealth and
this adaptation means that what once
felt like a big Improvement soon becomes
a new normal and we start wanting even
more to regain that initial excitement
think about the last time you upgraded
your iPhone at first it works really
quickly really thrilling to test out the
new features but how long does that
excitement last soon enough you're
already thinking about the next upgrade
and the cycle repeats with nearly
everything that we buy it's not not just
about phones it happens with cars homes
clothes and even social status and on
top of that social media only magnifies
this pressure and a report from Credit
Karma revealed that 39% of Brits feel
pressured by social media to spend more
money to appear successful or happy by
choosing to instead look poor You're
simply stepping off of that Relentless
tread Bill you're saying I'm not buying
into this no pun intended and the moment
you do that you'll find that the inner
peace you get from making that decision
and not feeling the need to compete with
every single thing will bring you so
much more happiness than staying on that
treadmill ever will number two we lose
Freedom of Choice when I first started
working in Investment Banking I
definitely fell into the whole keeping
up with appearances I wor designer
clothes a lot had the latest things
bought a nice car that was me and I
spent so much of my income on things
that made me look successful even though
I knew my bank account showed the
opposite but no one could see that side
on the outside I had it all but in the
inside I was stuck in a job I didn't
enjoy on this treadmill that we spoke
about constantly chasing the next thing
I was following the earn money spend it
and then expect happiness and freedom to
follow fast forward to 2 years ago my
spending on luxuries and wants went down
to pretty much zero for 6 to9 months I
was spending all of my money on
education skills learning putting it
back into the business and I made a huge
shift in my lifestyle for about 2 years
which led me to change my style of life
forever I focused on building a
Financial Security that let me walk away
from a six figure bonus and leave a high
paying job because it didn't satisfy me
I decided to focus on something I love
and genuinely have a passion for and it
gave me the freedom to travel whenever I
wanted I can genuinely tell you having
seen both sides that that feeling of
Freedom sense of empowerment Liberation
and being able to walk away from
something that no longer serves you
completely beats the Fulfillment that
you get from a new item for those couple
of years I followed the earn money
invest it towards freedom and then spend
it on other things if I had any money
left over when I talk about spending
zero on my wants or my fund category
it's because everything was going
towards education investing improving my
skill set and that's where today's
sponsor very nicely Falls in and that is
skillshare which is an amazing online
platform for learning they have all
sorts of classes from entrepreneurship
graphic design productivity interior
design side hustle ideas and the list
goes on and skillshare played a huge
part in my growth on YouTube because it
was where I went to every time I was
trying to learn something specific that
I had no background in YouTube was is
wildly different to Banking and so I
learned how to SCP through it how to
shoot how to edit through it and
anything else that I'm struggling with
someone will usually have a really good
class on it and I can learn from that
without having to search through
hundreds of Google searches and YouTube
videos with slower work schedules during
the summer period we tend to have more
time to explore our passions and hobbies
and so right now I'm taking this time by
Mimi Chow on how to draw which has been
a great way to get my creative juices
flowing again if you are one of the
first 500 people to click on the link in
the video description you get a totally
free 30-day trial where you can binge
watch as many classes as you want for
free thank you so much skillshare for
sponsoring this video the third reason
why looking poor is important is because
it takes you out of survival mode
Einstein famously wrote a calm and
modest life brings more happiness than
the pursuit of success combined with
constant restlessness a study by the
American Psychological Association
revealed that 72% of Americans feel
stressed about their money and a report
by the money and pension service in the
UK found that 62% of adults feel anxious
about their finances with 48% worrying
about money at least once a week in
today's world a calm and modest life is
pretty much Essential for maintaining
peace of mind and to reduce the level of
anxiety when it comes to your finances
if you get a bonus or a pay rise and you
get a new car that eats 40% of your
take-home pay you cannot afford to lose
your job take a break or even consider
other opportunities you're stuck in
survival mode upgrading one thing often
tends to lead to a domino effect of
additional expenses as well and Yahoo
finance listed car brands buy the
maintenance cost over the first 75,000
miles and they found that entry-level
Brands like Hyundai Toyota Honda are
almost three times cheaper to maintain
than luxury bands like BMW and
Mercedes-Benz when you upgrade there is
a domino effect on all the costs that
you have to incur to maintain that item
so instead the greater you can get the
gap between your income and expenses the
more peace of mind you'll have the
bigger that Gap the more freedom you
have it gives you flexibility to take
risks try new things or simply just take
time off if you wanted to there is
something called the concery method
popularized by Marie condo and it's all
about only keeping the things that spark
Joy by doing this you're not only
clearing out your physical clutter but
also creates space for greater mental
Clarity and emotional well-being you can
apply the same philosophy to your
finances it's not just about saving
money but also about reducing the stress
of maintaining this High status
lifestyle that puts you in survival mode
the thrill of a new purchase often Fades
leaving behind the anxiety of keeping up
the more things you have the more you're
in a cycle of living in survival mode
number four the power of Authentic
Living a really interesting study found
that 25% of Americans admit that they
have pursued a romantic relationship
purely for the money aspect and over
half of those people have misrepresented
their financial situation to attract a
partner if you base your selfworth on
external validations or material things
or the amount of money you have you risk
attracting people who only value you for
superficial traits authenticity is the
Cornerstone of lasting relationships and
this idea extends Beyond just romantic
relationships it applies to how we
present ourselves in almost all aspects
of our life as the saying goes don't
show off the outside of your house show
off the inside the outside is what you
display to strangers is an attempt to
gain their respect and admiration with
outward appearances in contrast the
inside of your house represents your
true self that's what you share with
family with close friends it's where
your genuine values and characters shine
through and in the novel their
adolescent the author wrote If I had 100
million I would nevertheless walk around
in old clothes because a knowledge of it
my consciousness of my wealth would
suffice this quote is what the essence
of true wealth is it's not about
flaunting it but about the inner
confidence and the security that it
brings and many wealthy individuals
understand this they often choose
Simplicity over showing they don't make
what they own their entire identity
because they know that living
authentically and valuing what's inside
over an outward appearance is a really
powerful way to build meaningful
resilient relationships those are four
reasons why looking poor is important
for internal happiness if you like this

MabD5R8kRak,"in this video I want to walk you through
my step-by-step financial plan on how to
use your money to live a happier life by
the end of this video you'll know how to
optimize your cash flow prioritize your
spending towards your life goals and how
to balance living in the present whilst
planning for the future if you're new
here I'm Nisha I'm a qualified
accountant and a former investment
banker and on this channel we talk all
things personal finance and
self-development let's start with step
number one your personal cash flow this
is essentially a measure of your
financial efficiency it's calculated by
taking your total income and subtracting
your fundamental costs so let's look at
an example Alex who earns 5,700 a month
from her salary and a side gig her
fundamental costs include anything that
is essential to her living so these
include reoccurring expenses like rental
mortgage utilities mobile phone
transportation and groceries minimum
debt payments and in total that should
make up between 50 to 60% of your
take-home pay once you have an accurate
amount which reflects the total of your
fundamental costs in any given month in
Alex's case 2,900 a month subtract that
number from your take home pay that is
your margin so in this case Alex's
margin is 2,800 per month so that's
within the recommended guideline this
margin is the amount that she can choose
to save invest or spend on non-essential
items understanding this margin is super
super important it's what dictates
exactly how much you can allocate
towards your life goals whether it's
saving for a house investing for an
early retirement saving for a holiday or
just enjoying life obviously there's a
finite amount of money that you have
available so whatever decision you make
will have an opportunity cost we'll talk
more about that in step for the key is
to regularly monitor your cash flow so
you always know where your money is
going and how much margin you have left
each month step two is your
purpose-based spending now that you
understand your Purp cash flow and you
know how much margin you have left over
each month it's time to think about your
current lifestyle and the life you want
to be living 5 years 10 years from now
this step is all about allocating your
margin to your purpose so let's bring up
Alex again Alex starts by think about
all the things that she wants to do and
Achieve she wants to buy a home with a
big Garden she wants to retire early she
wants to quit her job to pursue her
passion full time ultimately what she
chooses to do with her margin will
dictate each of these goals she can then
turn into reality so now she needs to
get super clear on how much each of
these goals are going to cost her so
first up she wants to buy a new home and
that's going to cost her approximately
500,000 that's a benchmark she's also
expected to put down 20% as a down
payment so she would need to have aimed
to saved up at least 100,000 plus legal
fees property tax and any other
Associated cost with buying a home so
let's assume in total she needs 120,000
she also as we said wants to quit her
job within the next 2 years is to do
something more fulfilling or even to
start her own business to do that she
knows she needs to build up a healthy
cash buffer or a cash pot set aside that
lets her take that risk and that she can
continue paying her bills from when she
does take it she also said she wants to
retire early she calculated how much she
needs during retirement and it's 50,000
annually the 4% role it's a very high
level role and it's used commonly in
retirement planning suggesting that you
can withdraw 4% of your savings annually
adjusted for inflation to sustain your
funds for at least 30 years so the way
to work out how much you would need in
Investments is you take your annual
number 50,000 in this case and times it
by 25 this is a back of the envelope
number that she would need in her
investment pot to be able to retire
early and that is 1.25 million so as you
can see with step number two you want to
think about your goals and put a
financial number that you need to save
or invest to be able to meet those goals
in any given time frame and then step
three is to organize your finances to
reach those goals so now that she has a
pretty good idea of what she wants and
what it would take to get there now she
needs to organize her finances around
her goals and essentially do a
feasibility check so let's look at her
first goal if she needs 120,000 saved up
within the next 5 years because that's
when she wants to buy her home given her
monthly margin of 2,800 she can now
calculate her feasibility so to save
120,000 in 5 years she needs to save
120,000 divided by 60 months
2,000 per month with a current margin of
2,800 per month Alice can comfortably
allocate 2,000 towards her down payment
goal this leaves her with an additional
800 a month for spending holidays any
other goals or expenses that she has
outside of her fixed living expenses she
should also set up autosave and put
those savings into a high interest
account to earn more on the money that
she's saving making it easier to reach
her Target potentially a little bit
sooner you also want to think about
other things that you need to do that
relate to the financial goal so in this
case you'll need to familiarize herself
with mortgage options interest rates the
qualification criteria this includes
understanding how her savings her credit
score and her income impact her
borrowing capacity so knowing this will
help her plan how much she needs to earn
and save to get the mortgage size that
she's aiming for now if Alex separately
wants to quit her job and transition
into entrepreneurship or even maybe a
lower paid job a more fulfilling career
she needs to focus on building that cash
buffer given her living expenses or
fundamental costs which she already has
calculated are 2,900 a month she would
need to save up just under
35,000 which is the 2,900 time 12 over
the next 2 years so if you break that
down you need to save
1,458 a month to build up that cash
buffer this is well within her monthly
margin but not if she's also saving for
her home at the same time and if she
does choose to quit how would this
impact her ability to get a mortgage
that's something else that she would
need to consider if she does want to
consider both and then let's look at her
third goal which is to retire early if
she's 30 right now and wants to retire
by the time she's 50 then assuming an
average rate of return of 8% she can
start by putting in 2,300 a month into
her Investments That Way by the time
she's 50 she would have put in 552 th000
but her portfolio would be worth 1.25 5
million which is what she needs to be
able to retire off if she wants to
retire even sooner so in 15 years then
she'll need to find a way to put an
extra 1,000 a month in which is more
than what her margin is at the moment so
she needs to find other ways to make
this compounding work if she does want
to retire early I'm not going to go into
the details of this investing section
asset allocation taxfree accounts that's
another Topic in itself if you do want a
video on that let me know but I also
have a free cheat sheet which outlines
what to do with your money on payday and
in what order and covers everything from
building an emergency fund repaying debt
investing in which accounts to them
prioritize completely free link is in
the description by going through this
and understanding how you need to
prioritize your finances to meet your
goals I want to emphasize on two things
firstly depending on what you want your
life to look like in 2 years in 5 years
in 10 years from now you need to do
different things with that margin to
make it happen with short-term goals you
can focus on Purely saving and tucking
that money away into a high interest or
high your savings account but if your
goals are more than 5 years away you
want to look at investing it to make
that goal potentially happen even faster
the second thing I want to talk about
here is that you need to take your goal
or your vision and to assess the
feasibility you really need to break it
down into what you need to do today to
make that thing happen in the timeline
or the time frame that you're looking
for it to happen in although your
circumstances will change you might get
a new car in the middle you might get a
pay rise in the middle you can always go
back and adjust the those amounts or
those monthly savings or Investments to
reflect your situation and the third
thing that you actually need to consider
is step four which is choose your
trade-offs every single financial
decision you make involves a concept
called opportunity cost in simple terms
opportunity cost is about what you give
up when you choose one option over
another it's like the Unseen cost of any
decision like choosing to spend money on
a holiday instead of putting it towards
saving up for a deposit understanding
opportunity cost helps you make better
informed choices by not just considering
the immediate benefit but also what you
might be missing out on so with small
day-to-day purchases I try not to think
of opportunity cost or sweat the details
if that thing that I'm buying costs less
than 0.01% of your net worth don't worry
about the opportunity cost just enjoy
the spending the two places where
opportunity cost really comes in is for
your home and for a car and for these
you want to carefully weigh the
immediate benefits against the long-term
costs and how impact your broader life
goals so firstly let's look at housing
tradeoffs in Alex's case choosing a
nicer home if she decides to go for
buying that more expensive Countryside
home with a garden she's foregoing the
prospect of retiring early or even being
able to build a cash buffer for her to
be able to quit in the time frame she
wants and I want to really emphasize
this here because it's virtually
impossible to plan for everything at the
same time so you're going to need to
prioritize what is the most important
thing for you at any given time so in my
early 20s whilst I was putting in a
percentage of my margin towards
investing in the stock market and
letting that money compound I was far
far far more focused on saving up for a
home that was where most of my money was
going once I then bought that home my
focus shifted and my next big goal was
to quit my job and pursue something that
I wanted to do full-time so then it
became building out a healthy cash
buffer and that is where all my margin
then was focused on and now in my 30s I
double down on investing to build and
focus on the freedom that I want had I
in fact chosen to rent a home for a bit
instead of buying I might have been able
to build the freedom part that I want
sooner I could have saved on the larger
deposit the fees associated with buying
a home and that huge amount of savings
could have been invested potentially
growing faster than property values over
the same period and in fact it has the
amount that I put in towards the deposit
for my home is worth less than had I put
that same amount into the stock market
but at the same time that was important
for me at that point in my life and
speaking of Investments I also want to
share a resource that has been a
GameChanger on my own journey to growth
and that is where I introduce today's

subscription the second big tradeoff is
a car so again I had a nicer car than I
needed for many years but when my focus
shifted and I wanted to desperately
build out that cash buffer I sold my car
I didn't actually need it and when I
sold my car I put that money towards my
emergency fund to Fast Track that cash
buffer which ultimately led to me being
able to quit my job sooner by focusing
on those really big purchases that have
a huge opportunity cost and evaluating
how these major purchases fit into your
overall Financial strategy you can make
sure that your decisions today support
your goals for tomorrow always ask
yourself when it comes to Big Ticket
spending how will this affect my
financial future and what am I giving up
by choosing this now so this is how I
looked at my finances how I used it to
build or to craft a life that I want
that genuinely makes me happy so I
wanted to share that with you in case
there's a financial goal that you have
in mind but you don't know how to
apprach it I love to hear from you what
are you focusing on at this point in
time let me know in the comments I'm
going to read every single one and if
you like this video you might also enjoy
this video that I have right here thank
you and see you there"
W15Bd-4NwBs,"after more than a decade immersed in
finance from a finance degree and an
accountancy qualification to spending
nine years in banking one of the best
skills I Learned was how to spot the
true markers of wealth so in this video
I wanted to share with you six eye
openening reasons while you might feel
like you're always playing catch up with
your finances or dive into the truth
behind that feeling and most importantly
how to use that feeling to your
advantage let's get into it number one
you're making upward comparisons there's
upward comparisons where we look at
people who seem to have more they might
have more money a fancier car a more
luxurious lifestyle and then there's
downward comparison where we compare
ourselves to people who appear less
fortunate or successful we as humans and
I admit this too find it so much easier
and we're naturally wired to compare
upwards but here's the thing a lot of
what we see when we look up is Just an
Illusion and the financial Mo that looks
so enticing is usually carefully curated
many people use tools and structures
that make their lives and finances look
far more impressive than they really are
for instance say you and a friend both
decide to budget 500 a month for your
cars you choose to buy a decent
mid-range car on a 5year finance by the
end of those 5 years you would have paid
off the car and it's yours valued at
around 20,000 on the other hand your
friend leases a car for the same 500 a
month their car looks much nicer and for
36 months they get to drive around a new
shiny car but Once the lease is up
they've spent 188,000 and have to return
the car with nothing to show for it same
concept applies to credit card debt in
the UK 38% of people carry credit card
debt and in the US is about 44% many of
these people fall under the debt
revolver category meaning they only make
the minimum payments on the credit card
balances each month the debt keeps
rolling over month after month making it
a cycle that's hard to break as they
continue spending debt is one way of
creating a facade of wealth it's easy to
look at someone else's shiny new stuff
and feel like they're ahead but often
It's actually an illusion of them living
beyond their means the comparisons that
really matter are with those who look at
investing for their future look at
people who put their money into personal
growth education skills these
Investments might not be as flashy or
visible but they increase a person's
future value and reduce their future
obligations it's a more grounded and
fulfilling approach to personal finance
number two you don't know what you stand
for We compare ourselves more often when
we don't know what we stand for although
we're talking about finances this
applies to every aspect of your life if
you're constantly focused on what other
people have what they're doing you're
always going to feel like you're falling
behind and I'll give you an example when
I was about to quit my job at the time
all of my closest friends were climbing
up the corporate ladder getting promoted
or pushing for middle management roles a
lot of them were buying their forever
homes as they were stepping into the
next chapter of their lives whereas I
was taking a huge step back I decided to
completely change what I was was doing
to study learn grow in a completely
different direction and although part of
me was really scared I didn't feel at
all like I was missing out I knew that
the direction I was going in was going
to make me so much happier and in
hindsight I was 100% right because now I
get to do this every day whereas in a
parallel world had I let that comparison
control me and not known what I truly
value and what matters to me I'd be in a
completely different place far less
fulfilling for me when it comes to your
finances knowing what you stand for and
forming your own perspective is
unbelievably important because if you
don't align your spending with what
truly makes you happy you're always
going to feel like you're lagging behind
you might find that you have joy in
getting the latest upgrades or designed
clothes and that's perfectly fine or
like me you might find more value and
experiences like travel investing in
learning starting a business I might not
have the newest phone or the trendiest
wardrobe but I'm content because my
spending reflects what matters to me and
that doesn't mean I'm locked into these
choices forever I can always change my
mind and realign with new values you
might not have everything that your
peers do but you'll have what you
genuinely value and that's far more
fulfilling number three you aren't
learning this concept is my favorite on
the list because transforming how I
compare myself to others has been
life-changing instead of letting the
question why does this person make more
money bring me down I ask how are they
achieving this this shift turns Envy
into curiosity and growth we often think
others have it all figured out
especially when they seem wealthier or
more successful and it's easy to believe
that they're just lucky or they have
advantages that we don't for years I was
skeptical about people making money
online I couldn't see how it was
possible to make a living from it but my
perspective completely changed when I
started learning and actually speaking
to these same people I learned they
weren't just creating content they were
building Brands connecting deeply With
Their audience diversifying their income
streams they were thinking outside the
box in ways that I had never considered
and this is something that comparison
can only offer when viewed through the
lens of learning and growth and the same
goes through investing when I talk about
investing or an 8% return a lot of the
comments are like how do you get an 8%
return no bank is paying 8% interest at
the moment you're right it's not but I'm
not talking about keeping your money in
a bank account the S&P 500 has returned
on average over 10% over the last 100
years across any 20-year holding period
the annual return has always been at
least 4% apart from during the worst
market crash in history and in 79% of
the time the annual return was 8% or
more and in 59% of instances that annual
return was 10% or more when you just
take some time to learn about what
someone else is saying and where it's
coming from and understand how they're
getting there your perspective and your
growth trajection completely changes by
the way if you do want to feel less
stressed and more confident with your
finances than ever before I'm hosting a
completely free master class we cover
where you need to put your money on
payday and in what order how to craft a
budget that actually works and what to
invest in to get consistent returns
completely free if you want to check
check it out link is in the bio number
four you're forgetting the tradeoffs
have you ever looked at someone else's
success and thought wow they really have
it all I know I have and it's so easy to
see someone thriving and assume they've
got everything perfectly sorted out but
we often don't see the personal
sacrifices they've made to get there or
the ones that they're still making to
keep it all together we miss the late
nights the Miss family moments the
doubts they've had to overcome take
spending habits as an example you might
see someone jetting off to an exotic
location and wonder how can they afford
that what you don't see are the
sacrifices they're making elsewhere to
be able to afford that perhaps they live
in a modest home they drive an older car
they skip out on new clothes because
traveling is the thing that brings them
Joy when you get to know people better
or you look at their lives holistically
you often realize that their sacrifices
might not be the ones that you'd want to
make understanding this helps you stop
comparing your best moments to theirs
because you recognize that their
struggles might be incomparable to your
own number five you're following the
wrong SE when it feels like everyone
around you is more successful or has
more money it's easy to fall into a trap
of competition but collaboration can
take you so much further than
competition ever will I've been working
on something a personal project for
about 4 months now and I had almost
finished it when a friend told me about
a similar project that she had just seen
launched online when I checked out my
heart sank I felt deflated thinking I'd
spent all this time and now I have to
compete with someone else who has
already done it and launched and had
elements of it that were better than
mine and I couldn't replicate I could
have just treated this as competition
but instead I emailed the founder told
him what I do gave him a high level
overview of my idea and how I think we
could collaborate and now we're working
on a new product that combines both of
our ideas and execution in one and this
really taught me that collaboration can
open doors you never knew existed many
people are willing to let their guard
down if you approach them with a genuine
interest and a collaborative Spirit it
often just takes one person to break the
ice and to set aside the ego and the
pride and the other person usually
responds in the same way realizing that
you're not out to compete but to build
something better together number six you
haven't focused on you for a while when
was the last time you truly looked at
your spending and asked if it makes you
happy it's easy to get caught up in
tracking budgets and controlling
expenses especially if you've been
following my videos you're clearly
dedicated to getting your finances on
order but in the process you might have
forgotten to spend on the things that
bring you Joy part of the journey and
getting your finances together is also
about enjoying the fruits of your labor
when you make room for spending on what
genuinely makes you happy you start to
appreciate your financial decisions more
and when you're building your own
Financial confidence and you're so
focused on your own path you won't have
time to Envy other people or even
compare to other people so this weekend
take a moment for yourself treat
yourself to something that brings you
happiness whether it's a nice meal
indulging in a hobby that you love a
small treat or even sitting down to
thoughtfully track your expenses for the
month let it be something that enriches
your life this way you'll find more joy
in your own journey and less need to
compare yourself to others thank you for
watching if you found this useful please
share it with someone who might be
feeling like they're financially behind
and just needs a little reminder on how
to let go of that feeling I hope to see
you next week"
Rl6pTMQSVo4,"I've been juggling here and there for
the past 3 years but it wasn't until the
last 3 months that I decided to make it
a Daily Commitment since then I realize
that writing on a personal level in a
way that no one else can see can
completely supercharge every aspect of
your life so in this video we're going
to talk about how and why journaling has
changed my life and I'll be sharing
insights practical tried and tested
tools and evidence-based strategies that
I use to journal effectively okay let's
start with how journaling helped me
there are a number of studies research
papers books on why journaling is
important but for me it really came down
to three areas in which it made a
noticeable difference in my life the
first is problem solving and I see it as
three layers in which journaling can
help you solve problems and depending on
what question you ask yourself it can
unpack your problems at one of these
three levels so the first level is your
everyday problems these are your
immediate relatively smaller scale
issues that affect your day-to-day life
for instance maybe you're feeling
anxious about a presentation that's
coming up or maybe you argued with your
partner yesterday and that's still
playing on your mind instead of letting
these feelings Fester you write them
down so that you can make sense of it
maybe when you write down that you're
feeling anxious for your presentation
you realize that it's because you're not
fully prepared or when you write about
the argument with your partner that
escalated unnecessarily you realize that
you just need to have a calm
conversation with them after you've
collected your thoughts and realized
what it is that's bothering you when I
just take some time time to write my
thoughts down on paper I'm able to
detach from them and better understand
what's going on so that I can sort
through my daily stress and manage the
situations more effectively then there's
big picture problem solving this is
where you map out your bigger more
strategic decisions so for instance
maybe you're working towards a promotion
but you're doubting yourself because it
requires hiring and managing a team but
you've never hired before and so you
don't even know how to go about it so
just by knowing that that is the
bottleneck can lead you to then seek out
the appropriate answers or even
resources or people that will help you
solve that problem so maybe you decide
okay now I know that hiring people is
something that is going to hold me back
from potentially getting promoted so
maybe one of the books that I read is
the culture code for recruitment by
Daniel Cole just to understand better
what good hiring means so for me last
week I was thinking about the direction
of my channel and I was thinking I don't
want to continue talking about personal
finance in every single video because I
feel like I'm sometimes repeating myself
and I'm not enjoying the process so then
I thought okay what about if I make a
video on journaling I've been doing it
recently why can't I make a video on
that and then I answer my own question
well it might not resonate with my
audience as much and people might not
find it as helpful okay so then why do
you want to do it and then I answer the
why and it's because it fuels my
creative spirit and it gives me this
added motivation to continue creating
and therefore I can also make better
Finance videos as a result okay cool now
I'm making sense of it all and I know
where I'm going so that's the kind of
big picture problems and then there's
the life problems solving and this is a
part that genuinely hands down change my
life and I do not say that lightly this
is where you ask yourself the difficult
questions that make you squirm if you
haven't asked yourself them before so
for instance some of the questions that
I asked myself a couple of years ago
when this whole change happened for me
included what would I want to experience
in life if time and money were not an
issue how do I want to grow what do I
want to contribute to this world where
am I going how do I want to be
remembered when I'm gone so I used this
book it's the Law of Attraction planner
and the first part of it asks you all of
these uncomfortable life questions and
at the time I did not enjoy the process
I wanted to resist all of these
questions but it's the questions that
you resist that we most need to answer
those are some of the prompts I did in
2021 and it made me start this YouTube
channel and forget everything that I
believed to that date about never
sharing anything on social media and the
belief of trading time for money the
life problem solving Journal questions
are the on that can completely change
the direction of your life the second
benefit it had for me was mental Clarity
and an overall better mindset there's
this book The Artist Way by Julia
Cameron really good book if you're
someone who wants to tap into your
creative side but you feel like your job
doesn't let that side out of you or if
you are a creative but you want to take
your work a bit further highly recommend
it the author recommends this exercise
known as morning Pages what it is every
morning you write three pages of your
stream of Consciousness thoughts you
don't don't worry about the quality you
don't worry about the grammar you just
put all of your thoughts from that
morning onto paper in a tone like you
are speaking to yourself rather than as
if you're writing it doesn't matter what
you write about it can be mundane as I
am thirsty and should have had a glass
of water before I started writing or
even if you don't know what to write you
can just write I have no idea what to
write and keep writing that until
something else comes into your head the
key is a to keep your hand moving and B
not to censor yourself no one will know
what you're writing EX accept you so it
could be as trivial as you want as blunt
as you want as rude as you want if
that's what you're writing you can't
write anything wrong here so I've been
doing the morning Pages for three months
now and I found this routine to be like
a mental cleanse where I can offload my
worries or my clogged up thoughts into
free form writing and it helps me free
out my mental space to focus on
completing other tasks with so much more
clarity and focus I've also noticed that
if I repeatedly write about the same
concern or the same thought day after
day my negative emotions towards it
start to disappear and there is research
behind this there was a study done by
James penaka he gave a group of people
the task of writing about the most
painful experience in their life where
they just wrote about the feelings and
the facts that surrounded their feelings
and they did it four times within the
space of a month and every time they
wrote about their thoughts towards a
situation it became more objective and
there was a lot more positive language
as they went on so this for form of
writing essentially can really reduce
your overwhelm and improve your mental
Clarity and the third benefit is the
insights and memories it gives you my
very first Journal is from when I was
about 14 years old it was a plain
notebook that my friend gifted to me and
I ended up using it as a diary and every
now and then I write about how the day
went what I got up to funny things that
happened on the day and if I didn't have
that diary in those years specifically
my teens which is where I wrote in at
the most between 14 and like 19 I would
have forgotten so many of those small
things that happened like how I told my
dad that I failed my driving test when
actually I passed it just to see his
reaction those small things you
completely forget about because they're
so minor in your day but reading it back
jogs that moment and that memory that
would have otherwise been lost forever
so I used a physical Book for a long
time now I'm using an app day one which
is also pass projected and I've been
loving it it lets you add voice notes
photos your location and it also has
prompts built in if you don't know what
to write so there's like a ready-made
template if you do prefer having a
physical book one of my friends uses a
5year on line a day Journal where each
page covers the same date over 5 years
so she writes one sentence about what
happened each day and then when a new
year starts she can look back and see
what she did on the same day in previous
years so those are the three main
benefits I found from journaling and
then let's move on to my top tips when
it comes to how to journal effectively
number one Embrace Simplicity you're not
writing a novel or a masterpiece no one
is going to read it we see Snippets from
journals in the 1950s or from our
grandparents and we think that what we
need to write needs to be revolutionary
no just write don't apply any pressure
on yourself whatsoever because it's
going to defeat the purpose of
journaling number two have prompts there
are days when I start journaling and I
have nothing to write about on those
days I find having these go-to prompts
gets me in the flow so I start with how
am I feeling how am I feeling about the
work that I have on today how am I
feeling about my relationships how am I
feeling about my fitness or my health
and that generally jogs me into writing
or thinking more deeper about those
specific areas in my life and then as I
start writing I ask myself why at every
sentence so why am I feeling like this
why does that matter and every time I
ask myself why to something I'm writing
I feel like it peels back another layer
of why I'm doing something and I
understand myself or the situation a lot
better number three set a reminder or a
notification to do it just for 5 minutes
in the morning it doesn't need to be a
30-minute routine just spend 5 minutes
whilst you're having your coffee or on
your commute to work doing it do it
together with something else that you
already do as part of your morning
routine so it doesn't feel like a chore
and number four really important is to
just let yourself get deep it's kind of
easy to write about what you did that
day and write about something fun that
happened and keeping it very surface
level the hard part is going deep and
asking yourself difficult questions that
aren't censored if you're scared that
someone else might see your diary and it
stops you from fully being open and
vulnerable You're not going to get the
same benefit out of this because
whenever I write and think that there is
even the slightest possibility that
someone might read what I'm writing it
completely changes my Approach I'm just
not honest with myself so think of this
as a safe space and just let go when
you're writing there is also a website
called squibbler which you can use if
you have this paranoia that someone will
see what you write if you don't write
for long enough it will delete
everything that you've written I don't
personally use it I like looking back on
what I've written but if someone's Senor
notes is what's stopping you then you

goes into the different prompts I use
that again were picked out of this Laur
of retraction planner thank you and I
hope to see you there"
N4g33GOqpaU,"have you ever caught yourself saying I
can't or it's not possible only to see
someone else has succeeded where you've
hesitated that was me just over 3 years
ago I spent most of my time watching
other people achieve all of their dreams
and goals whilst I felt like I was stuck
in the same place and I convinced myself
that this is just the way it is but I
watched other people achieve all the
things that they wanted to do fast
forward to today I've quadrupled my
income doing something that I love I
work with three team members who I love
hanging out with and I have the freedom
to work from anywhere and I hope
wholeheartedly believe that all of this
started with a few simple changes that I
made to my Daily Language and so in this
video I wanted to share with you four of
the most common phrases that used to
hold me back and what I say now instead
the first phrase to stop saying is
there's a lot of competition for a very
long time I had this belief that not
everyone can make it the system the
society everything is set up in a way
where only a handful of people can and
will succeed there's only one ESS will
hire for every job post there's only a
handful of promotions there are only so
many potential customers and with all of
these things you need to compete with
someone else to be able to get it and as
a result this idea of there's not enough
made me play it safe for far longer than
I needed to because if there isn't
enough resources to go around for the
things that I want which is also what
most other people want then there is no
way that there is more chance of
reaching my goals at the next level and
there's this section in the 4-Hour Work
week which explains what I'm trying to
say same and he says that 99% of people
in the world are convinced they are
incapable of achieving great things so
they aim for mediocre the level of
competition is thus fiercest for
realistic goals making them more time
and energy consuming you realize that
the goal isn't to beat the competition
is to create a monopoly or a niche where
competition becomes irrelevant where you
can achieve success without the constant
battle for market share when I stopped
thinking of the world as deficient I
stopped asking myself how do I beat the
competition and started asking myself
how do I escape the competition that's
when my goal completely shifted and I
started focusing on Avenues where the
landscape was less crowded which for me
meant pivoting onto the online space
where very few accountants or investment
bankers were I've learned that whenever
you are in a situation where you're
thinking about someone else getting to
what you want before you or having to
compete with someone else and then
taking what should be yours really
evaluate what race you are part of and
how you can change your approach all the
way you do it so that you're running
your own race number two more is better
there's this quote from the book The
Almanac which is desire is a contract
you make with yourself to be unhappy
until you get what you want if you watch
some of my earlier videos you will see
that I struggle with this one I had this
drive for more and more all the time how
did I make six figures by 25 how become
a millionaire by 32 I do believe on one
hand that you can't attract a lot of
wealth into your life without having a
clear goal or a desire to do so but
equally I've come to realize that
equating more with better is a flawed
mindset and as long as you always feel
this way you will never find the time to
be fully content and for me I found that
every time I reach a milestone and look
back I realize that the buildup to that
Milestone was in fact the most fun and
that there was no need to rush it and we
all do it we focus on the next house the
next car we put ourselves on this
hamster whe and as soon as we get going
it's then very hard to stop it's
addictive and no matter how many people
you pass up how much more you have you
just can't win you will never arrive so
something that I'm consciously doing now
is putting more emphasis on the personal
growth side of my goals even if it means
getting to my Revenue goals a bit later
that's okay if it means I'm enjoying the
journey to that goal and not
compromising my self worth for my net
worth by the way this idea of more is
not always better doesn't just apply to
material items or money goals but also
to digital items and that's where I am
super excited to make mention today's
sponsor clean my Mac clean my Mac is an
app that I swear by I decided to give it
a go as a last result before spending
money on a new Macbook and extended that
Max Life by another year with just one

using the code Nisha link is in the
description below number three saying I
can't people who become successful or
get anywhere in life would look at a new
opportunity and say here are all the
ways that I can make this happen whereas
everyone else would say here are all the
reasons why this can't happen for me as
soon as you take no for an answer you
take yourself out of the equation and
there's this situation that I always
think of before 1954 running a mile in
less than 4 minutes was considered imp
possible doctors scientists they
speculated that the human body was
simply not capable of sustaining the
pace required to break that 4-minute
barrier and naturally therefore the
mindset of Runners to break that
4-minute bark was I can't and then Roger
banister who was a runner and also a
neurologist approached the challenge
with a different mindset he combined his
training with scientific methods and
changed his mindset from I can't to I
can and crucially to I will and in 1954
he complet completed that Mile in 3
minutes and 59 seconds just a few years
later after this breakthrough so many
other Runners also started breaking that
4 minute Mark which just shows that this
barrier was a psychological one adding
just the word yet makes you approach any
opportunity with a completely different
mindset it gives you the courage to go
for things and rethink the limitations
that you put on yourself take inventory
for what is in your control because
there is a lot and number four is one or
the other chery sanberg wrote in her
book clean in when we're stuck making
decisions based on the way people have
always perceived things we limit where
we can go society's expectations often
present us with these false binaries
where told we must choose between for
instance being a good mother or pursuing
a successful career or being successful
and being kind it's just restricting us
to believe that it's one or the other
you can't have both and I always go
through these is one or the other
situations at different points in my
life and I'm going through it again and
I understood this concept of bicycle
face which really helped me understand
that a lot of these things are just
society's ways of telling us how we
should be and act not how it needs to be
and what it is it's in the late 19th
century there was a meth called bicycle
face and this was a scare tactic to try
and discourage women from cycling the
myth suggested that the effort of
cycling and the Independence that I gave
women could harm their health and their
looks in the same way Society often
places these binary labels to place
pressure on people to be a certain way
just as bicycle face was a fear to stop
women from breaking traditional Norms
the idea that women can't excel in both
their career and motherhood perpetuates
these outdated beliefs but in reality
there is nothing that says we can't lean
into the personality of having both just
as women pushed back against the stigma
of bicycle face to control the decisions
that they're making again we can also
break free from any other limiting
belief that we must choose one path over
the other when there is something that
is holding mean back from pursuing
something or making a decision I
question where that belief has come from
nine times out of 10 is what people
perceive and in that case it reminds me
that I don't need to limit what I can do
just because of what someone somewhere
else thinks so these are some of the
things that have really worked for me
and how I'm reshaping my mindset even
today to continue achieving the things I
want to do going forward if you like
this video and you're more into the
mindset side of Finance then you'll also
enjoy this video that I have right here
on six habits that may me six figures by
25 and also this video on millionaire
habits that changed my life see you
there"
__EETP29SGc,"this time last year I left my corporate Investment 
Banking job after nine years to go full-time into  
the world of Entrepreneurship there was a lot 
of back and forth in my decision- making I was  
wrestling with doubts facing tons of uncertainties 
and hearing countless reasons as to why it was a  
crazy idea but despite all of the reasons not 
to do it I found that there were five things in  
particular that I did before I quit that made the 
decision too quit a whole lot easier and hopefully  
by sharing them with you it'll help you decide 
whether or not you want to pursue a similar path  
and if so how to go about it the very first thing 
I did was build a creative thinking fund whenever  
someone asked me how I mustered up the nerve to 
walk away from a cushy well-paying job I could  
easily pack myself on the back and say oh I'm 
just a brave person or I'm a huge risk taker but  
the truth is that neither of those are true and a 
big chunk of my courage was backed by something a  
lot more tangible a financial safety net I had a 
large amount of money 9 months worth of my living  
expenses set de side to continue paying for my 
living expenses even if I made no money from my  
side business at the end of the day money affords 
you the privilege of having a big leap feel like  
a small hop by having some money set aside it 
made the risk of walking away from a consistently  
paying job a lot easier knowing that I wasn't 
going to be working from a place of scarcity  
or a place of desperation and that I would still 
have the focus and the freedom to think creatively  
if you have high interest rate debt as well 
then you also definitely want to pay that  
off before thinking about quitting and there's an 
Ord in which I would recommend which is build out  
a small Financial safety net first then pay off 
your high interest rate debt then build out your  
full creative thinking fund I have a free cheat 
sheet that goes into what you should be doing with  
your money and in what order it has all the steps 
I took in order to set myself up financially and  
it's all on one page completely free to download 
I'll leave the link in the description if you  
want to check out the second thing to do is to go 
evenings and weekends first it's hard to pursue a  
side business while you're working full-time 
I totally get that you're already spending 8  
10 12 hours a day at the job the last thing you 
have the capacity for is more work but if you do  
want to take this seriously you've got to make it 
work with the constraints that you have and one of  
the best things I did was to keep my full-time 
job whilst pursuing my passion projects and my  
interests on the side essentially giving up my 
weekends and my evenings to do it and instead of  
thinking of my job as something that was getting 
in the way of me working on my side business I  
thought of it as something that was funding it 
it was helping me build f that I could have on  
my own because I was able to use the cash flow 
to invest and to scale so for instance when it  
comes to my YouTube channel the first thing I 
invested in was a proper camera I upgraded from  
a day-to-day iPhone to a 1,500 Sony camera and if 
I didn't have a job spending that amount of money  
on a side business that I didn't even know would 
make me any money would have been a lot harder to  
do but knowing that I have the funding coming in 
made it a lot easier for me to keep reinvesting it  
gave me the freedom to experiment and not worry 
about any costly mistakes I make very quickly I  
then PID for an editor so I could keep focusing 
on the scripting and the creative side this again  
wouldn't have been something that I did had I quit 
my job I probably would have tried to save money  
in a lot of ways by doing things myself instead 
and I would recommend to keep your full-time job  
and focus on your side business on evenings and 
weekends until the income from your business is  
the same amount as your living expenses or more 
ideally you want it to be like this for 3 months  
3 months means you've cracked a formula and it's 
not just a one-off by the way one of the tools  
that I've been using from the start is Grammarly 
who are very kindly sponsoring today's video a  
huge part of my side business revolves around 
writing writing newsletters writing scripts  
writing captions responding to an email and in 
fact this is the case for most of us by using  
Grammarly I save countless hours on proof reading 
and writing that I would have spent trying to  
write something perfectly and what I love about 
it is it integrates across your whole laptop so  
you can use it on every single tool and browser 
that you open it checks my emails as I write them  
on Gmail proofreads my scripts as I work on them 
in notion and it provides me ideas for captions  
before I post on social media it will make your 
writing more compelling while still staying true  
to your tone and your style within one click 
and the best part is all of the features that I  
mentioned are completely free so you may as well 
give it a go you can get access straight away by  
signing up through my link in the description the 
third thing I did was to reframe the concept of  
taking a pay cut I have a few friends who have 
moved from banking to working for a startup and  
they've taken a pay cart in the process but they 
have equity equity in the startup so they've got  
a small small piece of ownership in the new 
company and if it takes off that small piece  
of equity will be worth 10 times more than what 
their previous salary was I thought of taking a  
pay cut to work for myself in a similar way so 
at the time that I quit my job I was making the  
equivalent of about $300,000 for my banking job 
which was my all-in package and then at the time  
that I quit I had made $4,000 that month from my 
YouTube channel I don't know at the time if that  
was sustainable but I did back of the envelope 
calculations and assuming I was going to make  
the same every month going forward I was taking 
an 84% pay up gross but I didn't think of it as  
a payer I thought of it as this is the equity that 
I'm building me going all in and focusing on this  
thing that I'm doing for me is building equity 
in my startup and so that was a mindset shift  
for me that helped me let go of a big paycheck 
and another way to think of it is you are paying  
for learning so say I was making 300,000 from my 
banking job and I quit like spent 6 months on my  
YouTube channel and then I realized it wasn't 
going to work I could probably go back into  
Banking and get another job sure it might not pay 
me the same amount it might be paying me 250,000  
if you look at it like that I wasn't then taking 
100% pay cart I was taking a around 15% pay cart  
to learn a whole load of business skills and that 
is totally justifiable if it means giving a shot  
at something that you've always wanted to do the 
fourth thing I did was test my commitment for 9  
years I was told what I need to do what I need to 
work on what I was aiming for I had this template  
that guided me essentially on my career trajectory 
meet these kpis get promoted bring in this re much  
revenue get a bigger bonus there was such a 
clear plan that when the idea of working for  
myself came around I questioned how I was going to 
be near as disciplined or motivated without having  
all of these structures in place and someone to 
report to the entrepreneurial world is not for  
everyone and a large part of it is because a lot 
of people do Thrive off having this template for  
their careers and what was for me A good measure 
of my commitment and discipline was how I treated  
my side business while I had a full-time job so 
when you have a full-time job and you're trying  
to build something on the side things are going 
to have to give I had to say no to a lot of social  
plans travel plans to really be able to commit to 
this thing and that was a really good indicator  
or a self-realization for myself that I don't 
need external factors to stay motivated if I did  
constantly find myself coming up with excuses 
as to why I shouldn't work on my side business  
and said go for this dinner or go out for these 
travel plans that's fine but then equally I know  
my priorities wouldn't change if I quit my job 
the same Temptations and the distractions will  
always be there one of my friends took a sabatical 
to work on her side business and instead in that  
time period She ended up just going traveling for 
two out of the three months and didn't actually  
work on her side business at all she came back and 
then realized that she's not someone who can work  
for herself she needs to be told what to do to be 
disciplined and productive and this was a really  
good way for her to test her commitment before 
quitting and going all in and number five reframe  
I don't know if it will work I was speaking to one 
of my close friends the other day she works for  
a big four accountancy firm in London and she's 
been doing it for nearly 10 years and she's got  
to a place where she feels hugely misaligned she 
doesn't want to continue going down this big four  
corporate route but she feels stuck and she feels 
like she's been out and she doesn't really know  
where to go from here she said she's always wanted 
to start her own podcast she's been thinking about  
it for the past year but she's been putting it 
off because there are so many podcasts out there  
already and she doesn't know if she could bring 
anything unique or fresh to the table the way I  
see this personally is that the goal isn't about 
winning or starting a side business solely to quit  
your job instead it's about making sure that you 
won't look back in 10 years regretting not taking  
a chance to do something that you truly wanted 
to do because the fear of regret is far bigger  
than the fear of failure if you keep walking 
down the same path sticking to a job that you  
know doesn't fulfill you you'll only feel more 
and more out of sync with your true self imagine  
yourself in a year 3 years or even a decade from 
now feeling increasingly regretful that you could  
have been doing something that you genuinely 
love now imagine on the other hand you gave your  
podcast or whatever your side business is a shot 
you wholeheartedly pursued it only to find out  
that it wasn't actually your thing after all and 
it didn't work out for you you won't then have to  
spend the rest of your life haunted by this whatif 
ghost you can return to your job and confidently  
say hey I chased my dream I listened to my heart 
and tried out that podcast thing turns out it  
wasn't for me and actually my day job doesn't seem 
so bad now that I know that I'm not missing out  
on my dream at the end of the day it's great to 
think about starting a s business it's great to  
think about starting a podcast it's great to think 
about starting a YouTube channel and investing for  
the future but the only thing that's going to 
matter 10 years from now is whether or not you  
actually did that thing and that was the last 
kind of mindset shift that really made me think  
well I've got everything else in check I may as 
well give this a go so those were five things I  
did before I quit if you enjoyed this video and 
you're really taking this side business thing  
seriously then you'll enjoy this video that I 
have right here which goes into the pros and  
cons of being an entrepreneur versus an employee 
thank you for watching and I hope to see you there"
AClbbISxa64,"seven things that I will never try to
scrimp out on again Having learned the
hard way number one accelerating
knowledge we love glamorizing effortless
success but success is never effortless
people don't accidentally fall into
being successful it takes work to be
good and a lot of work to be great and
the people who tell you otherwise aren't
telling you the full truth success
whether it's your finances your business
your relationship it takes investing
time and it takes investing money people
think that I'm just good with money
because I worked in banking for nearly a
decade and so it just comes naturally to
me but that isn't the case it required a
lot of work and I still spend so much
time and effort and money to keep
learning from other people and to keep
getting better I truly believe very few
people are naturally good at something
they've dedicated a lot of time to
getting good at that thing and by
spending money to tap into the expertise
of someone who knows more than you do is
just accelerating your growth if you
want to learn Spanish get some books
from the library download an app if that
doesn't work pay for a tutor if you want
to learn how to cook spend some money on
cooking classes two years from now you
won't remember the money but you'll love
having the skill of being able to make
amazing food anywhere anytime some
people laugh at this idea of paying for
self-improvement because you can learn
things for free on the internet but when
you realize that it's the same people
who haven't done the things that they
said they would it starts to make sense
there's nothing wrong with wanting to
pay to improve yourself the second thing
I've stopped scrimping out on is m Stone
memories this is one that I've learned
the importance of with time I never
really thought much of it in my 20s I
celebrated my birthday a few weeks goope
and it was the first time I've
celebrated in a very long time nearly 10
years and I did it because I realized I
don't really have many Milestone
memories I'm not really someone who
takes the time out to celebrate things
so I did something small this year and
I'm so glad I just made the effort and
spent a bit of money to do it properly
because now I will remember it's another
Milestone memory in my life and there's
this blog post I came across from more
to that and it explains this in a bit
more detail in relation to weddings and
why having a wedding makes sense people
often think of weddings as a huge waste
of money but Lawrence who wrote the
article talks about how it's probably
the only time in your life where you
have everyone you care about in one
place your wedding is like a huge IPO
and the return on investment is a huge
amount of time and love from everyone
you care about Allin one day it's a
unique Irreplaceable moment and it
symbolizes is so much more than just
spending money on a day and I realize
it's these key moments that I'm happy to
spend the extra money on because it's
these memories that I'll cherish for the
rest of my life and it's not just for
birthdays or weddings it could be a
graduation a family reunion or any event
that marks a significant moment in your
life it's not about being irresponsible
with money and needing to spend a huge
amount it's about understanding the
value of creating lasting memories and
to fully embrace them even if it means
spending a bit extra ultimately the
memories you create will be worth far
more than the money you spent number
three the Golden Triangle of Health
Sleep nutrition movement these three are
probably the most impactful solutions
for all areas of your life it helps your
emotional health your physical health
your personal self-esteem confidence
your work and finances relationships it
improves every area of your life but for
so many of us spending money on these
three things is underrated and we often
neglect it because there is a lag
between spending money on it and seeing
any return so it's hard to incentivize
yourself to spend but when you do
realize that it can make a world of a
difference to your well-being to your
focus and your productivity you realize
that it is not worth scrimping and
saving on even if you don't have the
most amount of money right now
prioritizing these aspects of your
health can lead to better performance
which leads to better output tools that
have a diminishing return it's funny how
things change when you're starting out
on doing something new I remember when I
kicked off my YouTube channel it was a
barebone setup me my iPhone and a $20
mic that was it I was all in learning
the ropes figuring out what's what and
honestly just enjoying the process of
creating something from scratch with a
mic and my iPhone but there comes to a
point where your growth with the tools
that you first bought will start
diminishing and the same tools that got
you from point A to point B aren't
always the ones that will carry you from
point B to point c as my channel began
to grow I realized that my iPhone and my
budget mic wasn't going to cut it
anymore and I needed to step up my game
I invested in better audio in better
camera I literally bought a new light
last week at the start it's easy to be a
bit scruffy as you're learning the ropes
but after a while expectations change
and as you grow whether that's with a
business a hobby or even just personally
your needs change and that toolkit needs
to evolve with you sometimes that means
spending a bit more money to get the
right tools for the job don't be afraid
to invest in yourself it might seem like
a little bit more than you want to at
first but the returns you'll see in the
quality of your work in your growth and
in your confidence will be worth every
penny next we have Safety and Security
when I find myself contemplating whether
to spend on aspects related to Safety
and Security I visualize myself in a
situation where something goes wrong and
I pause and let myself truly feel the
potential consequences of that scenario
and that exercise alone helps me assess
whether that extra amount of money is
worth spending so for instance imagine
you're getting married in a few months
you might consider skipping wedding
insurance to save money but what if
unforeseen circumstances led to your
wedding getting cancelled or postponed
without insurance you'll be left tens of
thousands down and in such a situation
an extra 200 invested today would seem
like a wise decision similarly if you
have sentimental jewelry that you value
but you never wear spending a bit of
money to get it tucked away in a safe
deposit box that costs a few hundreds a
year might seem like an unnecessary
expense but if you think about the
potential loss of those items or if they
get stolen that that cost of that
deposit box suddenly feels very
justifiable my advice based on personal
experience and reflection is always
allocate a bit more for Safety and
Security if nothing else it offers peace
of mind which in itself is priceless
hiring professionals hiring
Professionals in their respective Fields
whether it's a trainer a lawyer a
dermatologist is something I found to be
incredibly valuable and not worth
scrimping on when I started this online
business I thought I could handle a lot
of the legal paperwork myself having no
expertise in-law and I soon realized
that without proper knowledge and
experience I was missing out on
opportunities to optimize the business
when I got a proper lawyer involved
based on his experience and seeing so
many of the same transactions he would
point out small things that I should
have been charging on that was just
giving away for free and this more than
made up on the cost that I was paying
for the same thing happened with a
1-hour call with a tax adviser I paid
the equivalent of about $300 for an
hour's worth of device that saved me
almost $40,000
in taxes professionals have the
knowledge and experience that you can't
replicate with a few online tutorials or
books and ultimately it saves you so
much time and money in the long run and
finally retirement savings when it comes
to retirement savings it's one area
where scrimping and saving can work
against you planning for retirement is
about investing in your future self
you're essentially setting aside
resources now to ensure the Comfort
later on in life and it might seem like
a long way off especially when you're
young and retirement feels like a
reality but the earlier you start the
more time your money has to grow you
might be thinking I've got plenty of
time to start saving for a time and if
so you might be tempted to instead spend
that extra money on immediate Pleasures
instead but every pound or dollar saved
and invested is worth so much more in
the future thanks to the power of
compounding and I've made a whole video
right here if you don't understand the
power of what compounding can do for you
see this as a way of paying yourself
first that's the biggest mindset shift
you can make when it comes to saving up
for your retirement so those are seven
things that I have stopped scrimping out
on if there are other things that you
have scrimped and saved on and you
regret it let me know in the comments

eIw1l8hLInE,"we often think of Financial Freedom as
some distant concept something that is
reserved for a fortunate few or those
who are part of this exclusive Circle
but the reality of achieving Financial
Freedom is not on the far side of some
crazy complex set of instructions that
you need to figure out on your own and
so in this video I wanted to walk you
through the four-step payday routine
that I believe if you can get right will
help you master your financial life with
less stress and more confidence than
you've ever had before before I get into
it what does Financial Freedom mean to
you I asked you guys this question on my
newsletter some time ago and I wanted to
read out some of the Snippets from the
answers that I got Financial Freedom
means to me being able to choose where I
want to sit on an airplane and not
having to worry about the additional
cost being able to eat good food
whenever I want and enjoy a fresh
haircut every 3 months flying home to
see my parents I haven't seen them in
four years taking up a new hobby trying
a new experience just doing something
for the first time and not feeling bad
about spending money on it being able to
try a new business venture without
worrying about how it'll take away from
being able to pay for my day-to-day
expenses Financial Freedom is more than
just a number it's a feeling it's a
state of mind it's the idea of feeling
so confident and in control of your
finances that you're able to spend
freely on the things that you love today
knowing that it's not taking away from
your other priorities and your bigger
life goals so let's get into into the
four steps by the way if you're someone
who wants to go away and Implement
everything from a video step by step I
have a downloadable cheat sheet that
gives you the summary of each of these
points and details on exactly what you
need to do it's completely free and you
can download it in the description below
the first step is to track there is a
famous quote that is the first step
towards getting somewhere is to decide
you're not going to stay where you are
and then I would say the second step
towards getting somewhere is to know
where you currently are I always hear
people say I'm trying to save more this
year or I'm trying to spend less this
month and my first question is always
how much did you spend last year or how
much did you spend last month most of
the time they have no idea but if you
don't know where you currently stand how
can you get better so that's the very
first thing to do track where you are
right now you want to categorize your
spending into three buckets your
fundamental expenses your fun expenses
and then the amount you're putting
towards the future you fundamental costs
are your essential living costs so this
includes your mortgage your rent
utilities car or Transportation
groceries and minimum debt payments you
want to try and aim for all of these to
total up to less than 50 to 60% of your
take-home pay if you are thinking there
is no way that these costs can total
less than 60% of my takeover pay then
the two you want to start with focusing
on are your car and your home because
these tend to take up the biggest chunk
of our income and we don't need to be
able to afford to pay for the entire
purchase we just need to be able to
afford the monthly payments and so
because of this we end up buying a
bigger home or a nicer car than our debt
to income ratio allows so other than the
50 to 60% guideline for your fundamental
cost another way to see if you are on
track is to add up all of your monthly
debt payments so your mortgage your car
payments and any other loans or debt
payments that you have and divide it by
your monthly gross income and you want
to try and keep this between 35 to 50%
35% is on the good side % is on the
higher side if you want to balance
enjoying the things you love today with
long-term investing and short-term
saving then it's going to be hard when
you have a huge car payment or a
mortgage payment that takes up all of
your income it may be that you have to
make some uncomfortable changes in the
meantime but they will be temporary and
it will make a big difference once you
passed step one we move on to step two
which is to save and repay a third of
adults in the UK have no savings or less
than1 1,000 in their bank account and
78% of Americans don't even have one
month of their income saved up if you
are able to save just one months of your
living cost then you are in a better
place than most people and this is
purely for the psychological Comfort
when something goes wrong you already
have the financial stress of worrying
about how you're going to pay for it you
don't want the mental stress to go with
it as well once you've saved one month
then you want to pay off your high
interest rate debt now this goes against
a lot of the advice which you probably
see or hear online which is that you
should save up a 6 month emergency fund
first so I want to explain why I say it
in this order let's say you had saved up
5,000 earning 5% interest annually and
it pays you 250 each year let's say you
also have 5,000 on your credit cards
with a high interest rate of 22% costing
you 1,100 every year when we compare the
interest you earn with the interest you
pay you actually losing 850 every year
to take this one step further let's
analyze what would happen in two
different scenarios if you decided to
pay off your credit card debt with your
savings versus if you decided to keep
both your savings and your debt
situation A assuming no emergency
happens if you don't use your savings to
pay off your debt you continue to lose
850 a year or if you choose to pay off
your credit card debt with your savings
you'll neither earn nor pay any interest
so you're actually saving 850 year a
year now situation B an emergency
happens your roof caves in and you need
to spend 5,000 to fix it in option one
if you didn't pay off your debt you can
now use your savings for your emergency
leaving you with no savings and you
still owe 5,000 on your credit card
you'll continue paying 22% interest on
that debt option two if you had already
paid off your debt using your savings
you won't have the savings for the
Emergency anymore so you need to use
your credit card again so paying off the
debt will save you money in interest
payments putting you in a better
financial position unless an emergency
forces you to borrow again then you
would be in no different of a situation
than you were in originally that is the
reason why I talk about doing it in this
order once you pay off your high
interest rate debt then you can also
build out your emergency fund to 3
months 6 months while simultaneously
doing the next step as well which is
number three to invest this is really
important because this is where real
long-term wealth is created this is
where 10% of your income should be going
at a minimum and the way in which you
invest really depends on what path to
Financial Freedom you want to take
there's the investing in your self R so
this comes down to investing in your
knowledge investing in your skills
whether it's entrepreneurial skills
sales marketing business or skills that
increase your value as an employee so
for instance leadership training skills
that help you get to where you want and
build wealth Faster by increasing your
personal value then there's a passive
route which is investing in assets that
compound real estate the stock market if
you can dedicate 10% to this 10 % of
your income every month this money will
grow and compound and there will be a
point where you make more from your
Investments than you do from your income
let's look at two scenarios if you
started investing at 35 years old and
you invest 500 a month for 10 years then
by the time you're 50 you would have
19,6 34 and of that only 90,000 is your
own money the remaining 100,000 is free
money that you made in interest whereas
if if you started investing at 40 you
could still end up with a similar
portfolio by the time you're 50
91,4 but you would have have to put in
1,000 a month you're putting in double
every month so in total 120,000 of it
would be your own money and then the
remaining would be through interest this
is the power of compounding and why the
earlier you start the better you may
already be doing this through your
employer through a retirement
contribution and then you also want to
use taxfree accounts that are available
first and then look into taxable
accounts as well then the fourth step is
to manage there's a famous quote by
benjaman Franklin that is beware of
little expenses a small leak will syn a
great ship it's normal for your spending
to rise as your income Rises it's human
behavior but if it continues to rise at
the same Pace or even worse at a faster
Pace than your earnings then you're
never going to break out of a cycle and
feel financially in control yes you
absolutely deserve to enjoy the Finer
Things in life the beautiful holidays
the high quality items the experiences
that bring you Joy but equally you
deserve not to live paycheck to paycheck
for the rest of your life you deserve
the Financial Freedom to walk away from
a relationship that isn't serving you or
to walk away from a job that you don't
like without worrying about how you're
going to pay for your bills 10 years
from now that brand new car probably
isn't going to make you happy or
financially free but making the decision
to invest the money today instead invest
that difference that is going to very
likely be the thing that gets you there
you want to make sure that you take the
time out every 12 months to review your
finances increase the amount that you
can invest adjust your Investments if
you need to and as you approach
retirement make sure you evaluate your
risk appetite being financially free
doesn't mean quitting your job or
becoming a millionaire it's being able
to spend on the things that you love
guilt-free whilst knowing that your
bigger life goals and your aspirations
are also taking the front seat if you

F3Q-1W4QEVI,"have you ever heard of the phrases money
makes money the rich are getting richer
the more money you have the more money
you make in this video I wanted to take
you behind the scenes to explain why
phrases like this exist why your net
worth takes off at 100K and give you
tips on what to do to get around this
100K number and what to focus on instead
let's start with the why why does your
net worth explode at 100K many people
believe that reaching a certain
threshold suddenly grants you to
exclusive access to better opportunities
and these opportunities mean better
Investments which come with higher
returns and that is why the rich get
richer in fact there are two other
important factors that come into play as
to why your net worth explodes at 100K
and neither of which are related to the
type of investment you have access to
the first of those is the scale of
capital let's first consider the
reinvestments different scales all of
which offer the same 10% return so
suppose you invest $1,000 with a 10%
annual return after one year your
investment would go to $1,100 so profit
of $100 if you invest $10,000 with the
same 10% annual return your investment
will grow to $111,000 after one year
same percentage return that same 10%
just a larger absolute number so your
profit is $1,000 and then looking at a
$100,000 investment with the same 10%
annual return would grow to
$110,000 resulting in a profit of
$10,000 the investment the risks the
period are the same in all three cases
but the profits are significantly
different scaling Capital allows for
higher Returns on a larger amount of
your money and as you increase the size
of your investment the absolute return
also increases proportionately which
ultimately means you grow your wealth at
a faster rate the second thing that
people Miss is what they call the eighth
wonder of the world and that is compound
interest compound interest is put simply
the interest you earn on your
Investments so with compound interest
not only are you earning money on your
original money or the principal balance
but you also earn money on the interest
you've already made through that
original investment it's hard to explain
this without using numbers so let's say
you save $1,000 every month with an 8%
annual average return after 7 years you
reach a net worth of $100,000 that's
quite a long time about 7 years to get
to that first Milestone of $100,000 but
to get to the second milestone of the
next 100,000 that time period shortens
drastically this time you'll earn an 8%
return on a larger amount you'll earn it
on the first 100,000 that you've already
saved and you'll earn it on the interest
that that first 100,000 has also
accumulated so as a result the time it
takes to reach the next 100,000
Milestone reduces to 4 years almost half
the time it took to reach the first 100K
Milestone and then to reach the next
100,000 Milestone after that it'll take
you just over 3 years and you'll notice
that the time it takes to earn each
additional $100,000 after that gets
shorter and shorter as you have money
working for you already and then money
working for that money and then money
working for that money and then once you
reach $1 million an extra 100,000 from
interest a load will take you just over
a year the hardest and the most
timeconsuming part is often at the
beginning because you don't have
compound interest working for you so you
have to do a lot of that heavy lifting
yourself and that's also why a lot of
financial content for people at the
start of the journey is based around
optimizing every penny cutting out those
oat mil cles not buying XY Z is centered
largely around deprivation because at
this point every small Financial win may
feel really hard and like it's not
moving the needle much but it's those
small wins that when you put together
gets you to that first 100K once you
reach that every success then adds up
pretty quickly and the further into the
wealth building process you go the
easier it gets so keeping these two
factors in mind Capital scale and
compounding what are some of the things
you can do to make sure you're not left
behind if you don't have that 100k saved
up the first is to increase the amount
of time that you invest for let's say
you're on a salary of 60,000 and you're
investing 20% of that that means you're
investing 12,000 a year after 23 years
at an 8% average return you're going to
have about
$730,000 but if you invest for four more
years after that just four more years
you'll have over a million the real gain
comes at the end of The Journey not at
the start and so every single day that
you're not investing you're losing out
on the opportunity for time and
compounding time is the most important
thing you have on your side so even if
you don't have 100K to start with start
with what you have with more time your
Investments start to earn more interest
and then that interest and the principal
compound think of it like a snowball
rolling down the hill gaining snow
getting faster getting bigger and the
further down it goes it just gets bigger
and faster to the point where is just
Unstoppable and the gains are
exponential by the way if you are a
place where you want your savings to do
more for you but you don't know where to
begin and you're watching this video
saying yes you're telling me to invest
and to make the most of compound
interest but how then I'm hosting a
completely free masterclass in the next
month where I'll talk you through what
to invest in how to develop a strategy
that works for you and some of the key
rests you need to avoid it's completely
free to join if you want to check it out
I'll leave the link in the description
below the second thing that you can
focus on is increasing the amount that
you can invest it doesn't mean you need
a 100,000 lump sum to invest in straight
away but thinking about ways to increase
what you could contribute on a monthly
basis and notice I haven't said at this
point to find Investments with a bigger
return I've seen people obsessing over
what they invest in trying to get a 1%
or 2% increase per year in their
Investments optimizing for the best fund
the best strategy the best platform
which yeah sure it does make a
difference but the thing that's really
going to drive the results is just
increasing the amount that you can
invest to illustrate this if you're
investing $200 a month for 30 years at
10% you get just under $400,000 but if
you get an extra 2% per year from your
Investments you are left with just under
600,000 which agreed huge amount but
what about if instead of focusing on the
stock market and trying to optimize for
the best returns which let's be honest
is largely outside of your control you
focus on increasing the amount that you
can earn daytoday instead and look at
the stock market as just a way to
multiply your wealth and a place to park
your money that you generate in your day
day life so maybe through negotiating
your salary investing together with your
partner earning more money through a
side business and let's say instead of
getting that extra 2% return in the
stock market you're able to double what
you invest every month instead so
instead of investing $2200 a month you
invest $400 a month then you get to
$800,000 although there are many rules
for Building Wealth the path varies for
everyone my personal way to go about
this is to focus on earning more through
what you do in your day today really
kill it in that area whilst also
investing a small amount on a monthly
basis into the stock market so that you
can learn the investing habits early and
also let compound interest work for you
that way when you do have a lot of money
and you're ready to invest a l sum or a
large amount you won't be starting from
scratch and you would have already had
that Head Start so don't underplay the
combination of what increasing the
amount you can invest in and the time
that you could invest for has an impact
on your overall net worth if you like

FpcZdYU4MIg,"here are seven incredibly important
money lessons that weren't taught to us
in school number one money is tied to a
value there's this quote by Zig zaga
that is you can get everything in life
that you want if you will just help
enough other people get what they want
and by understanding this it really
changes your perspective on how to make
money we are taught in school and by
society that making money is tied to
employment what job you have the
industry you're in the job title you
have and I had this belief for so many
years until very recent I knew that
there was a way to make money outside of
the regular 95 and what I found very
encouraging when I dug into this a bit
deeper was that other people far younger
than me doing something that I wouldn't
consider as a traditional job seemed to
be a lot more fulfilled and making a lot
more money than me and that's when I
started to understand that making money
or making a lot of money really doesn't
have to be something that happens when
you're in your late 40s 50s or even 60s
and you don't have to follow this linear
path to get there instead is to do with
how much value you can give that's
money's true Essence is tied to the
value you create and the more people you
reach and impact who find Value in what
you're doing the greater your potential
to earn and if you look at the world's
most successful people entrepreneurs
designers artists they're solving
problems or fulfilling needs on a huge
scale don't think of money just as
something that can only come to you
through employment if you find ways to
provide real value to reach and impact
more people you'll find that money has a
way of finding you in direct proportion
to the value that you've contributed
another thing we were never taught at
school is to come up with our own point
of view throughout our education we're
trained to do things a certain way we're
train to follow instructions to follow
rules we're taught how to think and so
even after coming out of school and into
the adult world we keep that mindset
with us having your own point of view on
finances is one of the rarest things out
there and because it's not taught at
school we tend to follow what other
people are doing assuming that they know
better so it makes us feel safe with the
decisions that they're making for us if
everyone else is investing in something
then maybe we should too if everyone
else around us has an upgraded iPhone or
a new watch maybe we should buy that too
if everyone else seems to be working a
95 then maybe that's the best option to
go down I have my own point of view on
these things I haven't upgraded my Apple
watch since 2016 because it works
perfectly fine but I will happily spend
on a cleaner to buy back some time
whereas other people might think that's
a waste of money the point is it doesn't
matter what other people think about
your spending and investing it's about
understanding yourself and being
confident with your own point of view
regardless of what everyone else seems
to be doing or thinking the third thing
that was never taught in school is that
budgeting is freedom if you come across
a business that didn't know how much
money it was making what money was
coming in or out you'd be wondering how
much longer that business would survive
for let alone is potential for growth
this fundamental principle of tracking
finances seems like a no-brainer in the
business world it's essential for growth
it's essential for planning it's
essential for stability but when we
shrink this concept down to fit into our
personaliz it suddenly become something
we want to avoid because many of us see
budgeting as a synonym for cutting back
and living a life of deprivation rather
than the opposite what we want to see
budgeting as is something that can help
us strategically plan for financial
growth and freedom a budget is a thing
that lets you say yes to more in life
want to put down a deposit on a new home
yes you can afford to do that want to go
on holiday yes you can afford to do that
your budget is the road map that shows
you how to get to where you want
responsibly and sustainably by the way
if you like this video you may also
enjoy my free newsletter that comes out
every single week I share my lessons
from the week my favorite money tips or
money stories and I also throw in some
of my favorite tools podcasts or books
from the week if you want to check out
it's completely free and the link is in
the description below the next thing
school never taught us is that we should
spend on assets before liabilities this
concept is explained really well in the
book Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert kosaki
and it's the first time the penny really
dropped for me Kaki describes an asset
as something that makes you more money
while a liability is something that cost
you money for example put simply a
rental property is an asset because it
generates rental income for you while a
car is a liability because it requires
ongoing maintenance and expenses and
payments coming out of your pocket the
idea is to at the initial stages of your
wealth building Journey Focus heavily on
building assets and put the liabilities
on hold Investments include stocks bonds
real estate they're all examples of
assets that can generate passive income
once you've built up your assets then
you can focus on buying liabilities if
you want to but many people a don't know
the difference between the two and B get
this the other way around so they end up
as soon as they make money spend to get
straight away on buying liabilities like
cars expensive holidays material
possessions before they have built up
their assets as a result they're working
for money instead of having money work
for them so always buy assets before
buying liabilities the next thing school
never taught us is that career is your
number one money-making tool so find
what you love
about 90% of my friends are unfulfilled
with their jobs and this isn't uncommon
I've been there I know what it's like to
work in a job that doesn't seem to be
bringing you anything but a paycheck but
there seems to be this new level of
expectation that this is the norm the
expectation is that you're not meant to
enjoy your job and actually it's just
there to make money so that you can use
that money to enjoy things and enjoy
life outside of what we're taught that
we need good grades to get a good job or
have a good career but we're not taught
that your career is your number one
wealth building tool so you may as well
take your time to find something that
you truly enjoy and that you can stick
out for decades to come most people hate
their job but they're paid well or they
love their job but they find that it
doesn't pay them well if you could
strike a balance between the two even if
it means taking a few extra years to
explore new things or taking a step
sideways instead of forwards you'll
still end up in a really good place one
that most people will never reach the
sixth thing we aren't taught at school
is how to save money on taxes income tax
stands as a UK government's primary
revenue Source according to data from
the last tax year the UK government
collected 250 billion from income tax
alone and then a further 87 billion from
corporation tax although we know we have
to pay tax we're definitely not taught
how to optimize our income in a way that
saves money on taxes different income
streams are taxed differently employment
income is taxed the heaviest so this is
the money that comes through a 95 job
working for a salary or working for a
paycheck the tax bracket at least in the
UK can go up to 45% and that doesn't
even take into account the six figure
curse where the effective tax rate
you're paying money that you earn
between 00,000 salary and £10,000 is 60%
business income is taxed lower than
employment income no only are
Corporation rates typically lower but
you also get to deduct your expenses
before you pay tax reducing your tax
bill even further and then investment
income is usually the most favorable
from a tax perspective contributing to a
workplace pension gives you tax
deductions earning from stocks or Bonds
in some cases you aren't required to pay
any tax at all you're not going to see
these favorable tax rules with
employment income even a basic
understanding of this at school would be
helpful or even before entering the
adult world but it's never something
that's going to be taught because it
goes against the entire system if you do
want to learn more and take this into
your own hands I have a video right here
on my channel which is about how to save
money on taxes in more detail the
seventh thing school didn't teach us is
why investing is important if you invest
$1,000 in an investment which returns
10% you have the choice to take out the
10% you make every year or to keep it in
if you choose to take out and spend that
interest every year while keeping your
initial $1,000 in you'll have an extra
$100 every year in that case at the end
of 30 years you'd have $4,000 in total
1,000 that you'd already put in
initially and then an extra $3,000 from
the 10% interest you withdrew every year
which is the $100 a year times 30 in the
second case at the end of the Years
you'll have over $1
17,44 which is over four times what you
have in the first case that's because
you're not only earning interest on your
original $1,000 you're also earning it
on the interest you make on that $11,000
every single year as well when it comes
to compound interest the number one
thing that is working in your favor is
how much time you have so the earlier
you start the longer you have for
compound interest to work in your favor
those are seven essential money lessons
that school didn't teach us but should
have love to hear from you let me know
in the comments which one of these most
resonated with you and one thing you're
going to do for yourself after watching
this video thank you for watching"
Ruk9LwyLyYU,"hi everyone welcome back to the channel in this 
video I'm going to talk about five side hustles  
that you can start and scale to an extra $1,000 
a month each of these are ones that I have done  
myself or that I am currently paying someone else 
to do I'll also give you examples of other people  
who have done it and how much they are making from 
it before I get into it what really is the point  
of a side hustle and how do you approach thinking 
about one the way I see it there are two ways you  
can think about it firstly you can think of it as 
something that will give you an immediate second  
income so this includes things like babysitting 
um part-time retail jobs dog walking essentially  
anything that would feel like you're picking 
up a second job that is tying you into more  
work this can be great for an immediate boost in 
your income you have additional money coming in  
each month and you're not relying on just one 
income stream anymore but a it still has a cap  
on how much you can make from it and you have to 
keep working to have that extra income coming in  
and B it may not be something that fulfills you 
and that you get excited about the second way  
to think about it is as something that is on the 
site that is your own that Sparks joy in you that  
matches your unique skills and interests with 
something that other people are willing to pay  
you for it's flexible in terms of how much or how 
little you want to earn from it you have complete  
autonomy and it can if you wanted to scale it into 
something that completely replaces your full-time  
income for me the second approach is the way 
I like to think of side hustles and that's  
essentially how I treated this YouTube channel 
when I first started out it didn't feel like  
work I could work on it whenever I wanted to if 
I didn't want to work on it I didn't need to and  
it was the thing that overlapped what I enjoy 
with with the thing that I can get paid for so  
with that aside let's look into some of the side 
hustle ideas that you can look into starting with  
number one writing the quote content is King is 
originally from an essay Bill Gates Row in 1996  
where he described the future of the internet as 
a Marketplace for Content 28 years later content  
is definitely the king and almost all content 
stems from some form of writing as the base  
it could be writing scripts for videos it could 
be creating content and writing for websites it  
could be writing product descriptions for online 
stores it could be something as simple as writing  
catchy posts for Instagram Laura bgre started 
off as a fact checker for an author and then  
she moved and voted for a magazine and slowly 
she made her way up and before she created a  
copyrighting agency she used to charge up to $950 
an hour for writing Snappy phrases for Instagram  
and on some days she made up to $6,000 a day to 
write inspirational quotes for another business  
on Instagram I'm not suggesting you'll earn $6,000 
per day writing posts on Instagram from the start  
and almost like everything it takes a while to 
make a good living from this Laura Bel grey had  
a decade of experience before she got to this 
level but if you're just starting out as more  
people run their own business online there is and 
will be more demand for people who can write words  
for those businesses and there are loads of free 
ways to show off your writing skills you can post  
your own original quotes or tips on Instagram 
or Twitter or Facebook even if it's not in the  
kind of writing style that you want to offer it 
still helps you stand out to your target audience  
I'm currently working with a copywriter on two 
of my products and I found him through Twitter  
he was posting his work and reviewing the copy 
of other creators through his Twitter feed you  
can also write and publish stories and articles on 
medium or even build your own website and fill it  
with words that showcase your skills and have 
a page on that that has a hire me section and  
allows other people to contact you for more 
information the second is website building  
a good website is an absolute must for any online 
business but although everyone knows this a lot of  
small businesses and entrepreneurs don't have one 
many people still believe that creating website  
is super complex from designing the layout to 
coding the back end but actually with the help  
of website Builders and the latest AI it is 
a lot more straightforward than people think  
unless you need to create something bespoke 
and have cool features and moving Parts it's  
something that you can teach yourself and I read 
a story about a girl who began designing websites  
as a side hustle without any prior knowledge or 
background she then launched an Etsy Shop offering  
Web Design Services for $580 and over time she 
turned this into a full-time business creating  
a course and now earns a six figure income from 
it just from building and designing websites one  
website builder is Hostinger who are very kindly 
sponsoring today's video whether you're looking to  
set up a website or establish an online present 
for yourself or you're looking for ways to help  
others create websites as a side hustle hosting 
guy is a no coding solution that will get you  
started tell hosting as AI what look and feel 
you're going for when it comes to your brand  
and it will create a complete professional 
looking website for you based on what you're  
going for I've even checked out the AI writer 
which helps you craft SEO friendly copy their  
AI logo builder for Unique cool designs and I've 
also explored the eCommerce section which sets a  
stage for when you're ready to sell it feels a 
lot more like having a creative tool than just  
using another service and I wish I had a tool 
that was as easy to use as this when I first  
started so whether you want to create websites 
for other people build an online presence start  
a side hustle or your freelancer and want an 
online TV showcasing your portfolio Hostinger  
will have you covered the best part is that it's 
super affordable and you can get website hosting  
and free domain for £2.99 a month and if you use 
the code Nischa n i s c h a you get a further 10%  
off if you want to check it out I've left a link 
in the description number three video editing the  
Creator economy is stronger than ever and it is 
just getting bigger and bigger YouTube Instagram  
reals Tik Tok they are the strongest drivers for 
sales for a lot of companies and video content  
marketing isn't going anytime soon in fact over 
a third of all adults online are watching short  
form video content daily and 68% of 15 to 24 
year olds are as well there is this growing  
need for highquality video content and as a result 
video editors who can create professional looking  
videos and convey messages effectively are in high 
demand if I someone who had zero experience in  
video editing and I'm really not technologically 
savvy but I still learn how to edit my videos in  
2 weeks then you definitely can here is the cold 
email that my now full-time editor sent to me a  
year ago it wasn't overdone or anything extensive 
but at the time I was on about 100,000 subscribers  
I'd worked with a few other editors before but 
I didn't find that their editing skills fully  
matched mine so I was very happy for someone 
to come along and take this editing part of my  
YouTube process off my plate what I liked about 
this email is that he added value straight away  
he didn't ask if I'm in need of an editor and 
then wait for me to reply because I get four  
or five emails a day asking if I'm in need of 
an editor but he just provided value straight  
away by re-editing one of my existing videos in 
a slightly different style so it was really easy  
for me to check his portfolio and agree to just 
go ahead of course according to statistics by zip  
recruiter as of March 24 the average hourly pay 
for a freelance video editor is $31 an hour by  
dedicating 2 hours each weekday to editing you 
can earn up to $1,360 adding an additional two  
hours of work on the weekends you can increase 
your earnings to nearly $2,000 a month extra  
you can post your services on upwork or Fiverr I 
find that they are quite crowded so instead look  
for a creator that you like the style of that you 
can replicate and that you can add value to them  
straight away and if they like you they'll be very 
happy to pay you a good amount to take the editing  
off their plate number four a community manager 
this is a recent one that is becoming more and  
more in demand a lot of creators and businesses 
are starting online communities either free or  
paid ones to allow the audience to interact with 
each other and exchange experiences and just hang  
out together online and this community can be 
in Discord it can be slack telegram Facebook  
school and all of these communities need someone 
to oversee it a community manager is basically a  
person who supports the community in every way 
so they're monitoring it they're checking all  
the posts and the messages making sure they're 
going with the guidelines they encourage people  
to write they start a discussion they answer 
questions they encourage people to communicate  
and the thing that I love about this side hustle 
is that you can find a community that resonates  
with your interest so you're just getting paid to 
talk about things that you love these communities  
can be super diverse ranging from book clubs to 
communities about gardening Modern Art computer  
games DIY furniture and so many other things 
that can align with what you like if you find  
a community that aligns with your interest it's 
something that won't even feel like work as of  
March 2024 the average hourly pay for a freelance 
Community manager is $28 an hour and number five  
become a solar preneurs virtual assistant/ 
operations manager this is a really good one  
and it's one of those jobs that solar printers 
need but may not actually realize that they need  
it it's essentially a second pair of hands or a 
second pair of eyes that can help solo preneurs  
build out project plans outline strategies and 
execute on their ideas you can do this by signing  
up to a website that pairs you with clients so you 
don't have to Market yourself but what I recommend  
is finding someone online that you find inspiring 
that you want to learn from that are in a field  
that is similar to the one that you want to get 
involved in and reach out to them early last year  
I got an email from someone who ended up being 
my virtual assistant she sent me an email asking  
me if I needed to help with calendar scheduling 
checking emails doing all the design for the brand  
she showed me examples of her work that she's done 
and these were all things that I was struggling  
to find time to do I had a full-time jobs and I 
didn't even think that these are things that I  
could just hire someone else to do and then as we 
started working together and the channel grew she  
started getting involved in more and more things 
from understanding how the marketing email funnels  
work to designing the websites and as she learned 
more and more she started applying the knowledge  
and the stuff that was going on into the projects 
that she did on her own so just by being around  
a person who's doing something that you want 
to do it helps you unlock a lot of ideas and  
opportunities further down the line that you 
didn't even know existed before you entered  
the world so those are five side hustles that 
I didn't know about until I entered this online  
world where the opportunities are endless if you 
try any of these out or if you're in the process  
of trying out a side hustle let me know I'd love 
to hear from you thank you for watching and you  
might enjoy this video over here that talks about 
passive income ideas that you may want to consider"
wSNDz6GCLD0,"Thank you to HubSpot for sponsoring this video 
here are 30 things I know in my 30s that I wish  
I knew in my 20s starting with number one it's 
far more fun to be the person being discussed  
than the other way around you'd rather be 
busy living your own life than to get to  
your 30s 40s and 50s realizing that you've just 
been complaining criticizing or judging the way  
other people are living their life number two stop 
complaining if you have the ability to take action  
to do something to remove the thing that you're 
complaining about but you're choosing not to do  
it then you have no right to continue complaining 
number three you get what you pay for you can get  
a pair of shoes for $10 or you can get it for $200 
but there is a reason for the difference from the  
products you buy to the work you delicate to 
others a higher price tag usually comes with  
better quality as the saying goes don't expect 
champagne with lemonade money number four don't  
take things personally most people mean well and 
are good thinking otherwise makes you miss out  
on creating meaningful relationships number five a 
work in days not weeks instead of saying I can get  
this done by the end of next week say I can get 
this done by the end of today shortening the time  
frame will make you switch your mind into thinking 
about working harder to working smarter number six  
outwork your impostor syndrome imposter syndrome 
is how you see yourself not how others see you  
nor your actual abilities when you do things that 
are hard and you stretch your limits you'll gather  
proof of your abilities and the fear of not being 
good enough will eventually fall away number seven  
you playing small doesn't serve anyone not only 
only are you holding yourself back but you're also  
denying other people to benefit from your ideas 
and your contributions take risks take big swings  
number eight success is personal during your 20s 
and 30s all of your friends will be in completely  
different places some will be single living their 
best life others will be married others will be  
getting married or having kids others will be 
crushing it in their career it's super easy to  
always feel behind so stay in your own lane 
and avoid looking left and right number nine  
have regular check-ins is too easy to operate 
on autopilot only to check in years later and  
realize that you've actually reached the wrong 
destination whenever you can ask yourself do I  
actually want this why do I want this and would 
I still be happy if I was doing this in 5 years  
time number 10 getting into work early isn't going 
to get you promoted when issues come up you want  
people to think of you as a sole person who can 
solve that problem focusing on value is the bit  
that will make you indispensable not just your 
punctuality number 11 fail fast and fail forward  
sometimes it will take 100 NOS before you get to 
that one yes that you've been looking for but if  
you aren't okay to fail you're not going to be 
moving forward in the first place the goal is to  
outpace your competition by failing faster and 
learning from it number 12 don't expect other  
people to do your work as the say goes you are 
the sum of The Five People You spend the most  
time with if you want to change your circle the 
people you want to surround yourself with should  
also want to surround themselves with you there's 
a level of work that you have to put in yourself  
before expecting other people to help you number 
13 it's never too late to try something new when  
I was in my late 20s I kept telling myself it's 
too late for me to leave my corporate job and  
start my own thing now I'm saying the same thing 
about something else the truth is there will be  
people younger than you that are doing the thing 
that you want to do and people far older than you  
doing it the time is going to pass anyway the 
only person missing out is you number 14 Define  
what you want most people don't actually know 
what they want they just want what they think  
they should want Define what it is that you 
actually want and then move on to number 15  
which is do the thing that you need to do to get 
what you want it's easy to daydream about getting  
what you want but most people aren't willing 
to do what they need to do to actually get it  
it's easier more than ever to find resources that 
will get you from point A to point B I know many  
of you watch my content because you're trying to 
achieve Financial Independence build skills scale  
businesses from Z there are plenty of books you 
can read podcasts you can listen to one resource  
I recommend is to check out this free guide Linked 
In the description that was written by Hubspot on  
what it takes to be a solopreneur it covers how 
to get into the mindset of a solopreneur the most  
important skills you need as a solopreneur as well 
as the main people you need to hire or to have in  
your journey as a solopreneur and why and these 
are things that took me over a year to understand  
and learn the importance of it also includes a 
step-by-step part on how to set up systems which  
has been really helpful me as I'm trying to figure 
out what parts of my business I can automate and  
not be so involved in so that I can try and focus 
on other things that will help me scale once again  
this guide was created by HubSpot who are very 
kindly sponsoring today's video I recommend you  
check out the free resource which you can find 
in the link in the description number 16 there  
is no such thing as overnight success no matter 
how effortless someone else's achievements might  
appear there seemingly overnight success is often 
the result of Decades of work don't underestimate  
the hard work that is requir to achieve 
extraordinary results number 17 don't take advice  
for someone who hasn't done what you're trying 
to do everyone loves having an opinion on what  
works and what doesn't but if they haven't done 
it themselves and they're telling you how to do it  
think twice about following what they have to say 
number 18 other people are rarely your competition  
if you want to go fast go alone but if you want to 
go further go together you're going to get further  
by learning from each other than by competing with 
each other number 19 mornings are important if  
you start off your day by jumping straight into 
working for others you'll leave no time energy  
or creativity for yourself an extra 30 minutes 
every morning is sometimes all it takes number  
20 focus on one thing at a time the more you grow 
the more opportunities come at you the ability to  
focus on one thing at a time and make that thing 
really really good will get you further than doing  
multiple things half-heartedly all at once number 
21 don't rush to find your Niche the last thing  
you want is to burn out out from pursuing a path 
that isn't right for you I made this mistake and  
spent many years doing something I didn't enjoy

WFdIiw-IMz0,"if you live in the UK you've likely
heard of the term Isa you might be
wondering what it is why it matters how
it applies to you and why they couldn't
come up with a more interesting name for
it so in this video I wanted to break
down three out of the Four Points I just
mentioned and what exactly you need to
do before the 5th of April before we
begin I'm Nisha I'm a qualified
accountant and on this channel we
discuss all things personal finance and
self-development let's start with what
is an Isa if you got some money set
aside in a Money Pot you might decide
you want to make that money grow you
want to make money from that money you
could do this by depositing those
Savings in a bank and earning interest
on it or by investing it in the stock
market the issue is that when you make
money from these savings or these
investments in many cases the tax man
comes back and wants to take a piece of
those earnings that's where an Isa or an
individual savings account comes in each
year you get an allowance for the money
that you can put away to protect it from
tax that means all of the interest you
earn on that money and all of the
interest on interest that's compounded
over decades is yours and will be yours
taxfree so how does this work an Isa is
not an investment it's the account that
protects your investment or protects
your money it's a wrapper or let's call
it a box for better visualization where
your money sits in to protect it from
taxes there are different types of isers
which all have different features and
benefits inside depending on what you
want to achieve with your savings and
the most popular two are the stock and
shares Isa and the cash Isa the amount
of savings you can put away into this
box to protect it from tax in any given
tax year is 2,000 note that this may
change and Jeremy Hunt has spoken about
introducing British isers but right now
that £20,000 is still what applies and
you have the option to put that 20,000
in a single Isa such as all in a stocks
and shares Isa or you can split it up
and divid it into different types of
isers so for example you could put
10,000 in a cash Isa and 10,000 in a
stocks and shares Isa but you must
deposit it before the 5th of April for
it to apply in that tax year because if
you don't you lose that allowance and
you can't claim it back in subsequent
years that allowance does not carry over
once you've used up that Year's
allowance you could then add another
20,000 on the sixth of April for the
following tax year and then another
20,000 in the year after that and so on
and that is why the end of the tax year
is really important because if you Max
it out or if you put your money into
these isers it's possible to accumulate
hundreds of thousands over years
completely taxfree let's explain the
different types of isers now starting
with a cash iser if you're using a
standard savings account and if you have
a lot of money in savings then you might
be paying tax on your savings if you're
going over the personal allowance
thresholds what are those thresholds if
you're a basic rate taxpayer and I'll
leave a link below so you can understand
where you fall you can earn up to 1,000s
in interest per year taxfree anything
above that will be taxed if you're a
higher rate tax taxpayer so you're in
the 40% tax bracket you can earn up to
£500 in interest per year taxfree and
then you start paying tax on any
additional interest you earn and then if
you're an additional rate taxpayer you
don't have a taxfree allowance at all
you can't earn anything taxfree it's all
taxed and remember those numbers so
those that £1,000 and that £500 is the
interest you can earn so you need a lot
of savings to generate that amount in
interest and before 2022 very few people
pay tax on savings interest because of
the low interest rate environment at the
time but now rates have risen and basic
rate taxpayers need around £20,000 in
normal savings to start paying tax on it
and higher rate taxpayers need around
£10,000 to start incurring tax so if you
already pay tax on your savings or
you're near the limit where you will
earn enough in interest to start paying
tax on it then a cash ISO will protect
you from further tax everything you have
within a cash Isa is protected all the
interest you earn year after year will
be taxfree so again you could put
£20,000 into a cash Isa this year
£20,000 into the next tax year 20,000 in
the tax year following that you can have
60,000 in a cash Isa and the interest
will never be taxed it will always be
taxfree and just like normal savings
cash is also come in different types
you've got easy access where you can
withdraw whenever you want you've got a
fix freay where you can get a Guaranteed
Rate but you're supposed to lock that
cash in for a set amount of time the
second type of Isa is a stocks and
shares Isa and that is a tax-free
investment account so let's say you
invested £5,000 into JD Sports in 2009
and sold it in 2019 the return on that
investment would have been over £47,000
if you invested through an ISO account
that full amount would have been yours
to keep taxfree you wouldn't have paid a
single penny in taxes on the capital
gains in reality the chances of picking
a winning stock are low but the point
remains is that if you invest in
something like the P 500 or a global
market index fund and hold on to it for
10 years 15 years 20 years which based
on past returns you can expect a return
of around 7 to 8% over the long run that
interest on interest will compound over
time and then the money you earn will be
taxfree this is why stocks and share
isers are a really popular and effective
way to build wealth because historically
the stock market has provided a higher
return than if you had kept your money
into a savings account if you're not
ready to start investing or if you're
ready to start investing but you don't
want to invest everything immediately
you can also store your money as cash
with an investment broker until you're
ready so this way you don't lose that
£20,000 allowance for the year I moved a
third of my emergency fund into my
trading 2 on2 stocks and shares I sell
which currently provides a 5% interest
on cash balances paid out daily so
firstly my emergency fund gains interest
even though I'm not actively investing
it secondly I still have quick access to
my funds whenever I need it and thirdly
it stops me from wasting my use it or
lose it benefit for the year I've linked
a list of investment platforms I
recommend and use and at this time of
the year some of them are offering
really good perks and bonuses so for
instance invest engine if you're
thinking to transfer your ISO across to
them before the 30th of April you can
get a bonus of up to 22,500 as always
terms and conditions apply it depends on
how much you're going to be moving
across the final type of Isa I wanted to
mention is the lifetime Isa or the lyser
think of this as a retirement account
which is also particularly useful if
you're looking to buy your first home in
the next year or become a homeowner at
some point in the future so you can open
up a lifetime Isa if you're aged between
18 and 39 and once it's open it can
remain open forever but you must open
the account within that age range with a
lyser you can get a 25% bonus from the
state on everything you put in up to
£4,000 £4,000 is the maximum you can put
in if you Max it out with that full
4,000 every year then you receive an
addition 1,000 per year from the state
if you put £1,000 in you get £250 from
the state and that's before interest or
investment growth with a lifetime isy
you can't withdraw the money unless
you're using it to buy your first home
or unless you have reached retirement so
60 years plus or if there is a specific
type of emergency there are some
conditions if you are using it to buy
your first home one being that the
property must cost less than £450,000
again I'll link below so get the more
details on what exactly those conditions
are you can use the money in the
lifetime Isa as you want either as cash
or as investment so a cash option might
be the better choice if you're saving
for your first home and you're planning
to buy within the next couple of years
whereas a stocks and shares one may be a
better option if you're saving for
long-term saving for retirement and
allows you to ride out any dips in the
stock market during that time the
downside and this is a pretty big
downside making it almost an
unreasonable option in my opinion is
that if you withdraw money without
buying a qualified home or before you
turn 60 there's a penalty so you pay 25%
on the amount that you withdraw so not
only do you use that government bonus
you also get back less than you had
originally put in so that is something
you want to consider before considering
a lifetime Isa there are other Isa
Junior Isa Innovative Finance Isa if you
want me to make a separate video going
into detail on those as well let me know
for now I've just discussed the two most
popular ones so that you know what to
before the 5th of April if you take one
thing away from this video open up your
stocks and shares eyesight even if
you're not ready to invest just to avoid
losing this year's allowance remember
you can always take your money out again
and put it back in later to catch up
again but if you lose that personal
allowance for the year it's gone you
can't claim it back I provided links to
investment platforms that you can use

LKMXSANgCR4,"one of the most common questions I get asked is 
should I set up my business as a limited company  
or as a sole Trader on one hand you might think 
that a limited company is the best option for you  
because it provides protection to your assets 
and means you can scale on the other hand you  
may believe that a sole Trader is better because 
it's far less hassled to set up and it can mean  
you pay less in tax making the right decision 
can be one of the most important things you can  
do when starting out so in this video I'm going 
to be talking about the key differences between  
both of these structures the advant an ages and 
disadvantages of each and at what point you should  
consider switching from one to the other if you're 
new here I'm Nischa I'm a qualified accountant  
and this channel is all about personal finance 
Building Wealth and self-development let's get  
into it when you first set up a business you need 
to choose a structure and the two basic ones to  
choose between a soul Trader and a limited company 
so what's the difference at the basic level as a  
soul Trader you are the business so say you are 
a personal trainer you're doing onetoone sessions  
with people and they pay you for it this is you 
and this is also your business is an extension  
of yourself and your personal name represents 
your business this means that all your business  
dealings invoicing contracts are done under your 
personal name one of the advantages of setting up  
as a sole Trader business is that the process 
is super simple and low cost you just need to  
a track your earnings and expenses over the year 
and B at the end of the financial year complete  
a self assessment tax return quick easy and noow 
cost and so it's a very attractive option to start  
with in most cases there are however some clear 
exceptions where this is absolutely not the way  
to go and I'll come to that in the text part of 
the video now a limited company is you operating  
under a separate legal entity from yourself so 
this is you a personal trainer and you set up  
a company Pilates limited let's call it minus 10 
points for lack of creativity you register your  
company with company's house and that company 
or the business is very separate from you as  
an individual you may own the company so you can 
be a director or a shareholder in it and you can  
have multiple directors and shareholders in it as 
part of the business it's a separate legal entity  
to you and the company does all the business so 
the invoices the contracts all of that is under  
the company name setting up a company has also 
become very very quick and very easy to do but  
when it comes to the tax returns that's when it 
gets more complex you'll need to do a tax return  
both for your company and for you personally 
and so the extra paperwork and the tax rules  
to follow that come with having a company come 
with an extra cost and it's a lot more expensive  
to do your accounts company than it is as a 
soul Trader basis okay so now we've covered  
the high level difference between a soul Trader 
and a limited company and the difference in the  
structures now let's talk about the advantages 
and the disadvantages for each of these and when  
to use which one before I get into it I want to 
give a quick mention to today's sponsor Dropbox  
as a business owner managing different aspects of 
a business can be overwhelming there are hundreds  
of moving parts and things to keep on top of no 
matter what industry you're in for me I had to  
make sure that the different people in my team 
were always aligned regardless of where in the  
world they're working from I speak to loads of 
Brands I need to make sure that my lawyer has a  
latest version of an agreement all the files were 
saved in the right place we had so many apps and  
systems that we kept switching between then we 
came across Dropbox business and business plus  
which has simplified the entire process instead of 
paying for various subscriptions and tools we just  
have Dropbox where we can handle everything in one 
centralized location and it's more cost effective  
and saves us a lot of time I love the E signatures 
capability so being able to prepare send sign  
contracts ndas and any other necessary paperwork 
from anywhere and my personal favorite Dropbox  
capability is replay I can give real time exact 
timestamp feedback add markups and leave comments  
for my Editor to look at and amend straight away 
by centralizing all of our most important tasks  
we're no longer wasting time jumping from app to 
app if you're looking for an all-in-one solution  
to organize your professional life I'd highly 
recommend checking it out you can click the link  
in the description to learn more about Dropbox 
business now onto the tax implications the way  
the tax is structured for a soul Trader and a 
company can make all the difference in which one  
you choose let's use an example of earning 100,000 
after all your expenses for a soul Trader this  
would be taxed just like income tax because you 
are the one getting paid so you get your personal  
allowance and you can utilize that assuming 
it isn't already used up through any of your  
other income sources so the first 12,570 in this 
case at the current time is taxfree the amount  
you earn above that is taxed at a progressive tax 
rate so the amount you earn after 12,570 up until  
50270 is taxed at 20% and then the remaining 
amount between 5271 and 100,000 is taxed at 40%  
I have a video linked over here that goes into 
the details of how the progressive tax system  
works in more detail but you can also check that 
out after this video but bear in mind you also  
have to pay ni on this as well for corporation 
tax it's structured slightly differently and  
you might be thinking how do I get paid well the 
company earns money and then it can either pay you  
a monthly salary on which you have to pay income 
tax and National Insurance so the same rates that  
you had in the soul Trader example or you can get 
paid via dividends Dividends are the payments the  
that have a profit of between 50,000 and 250,000 
is 25% minus any marginal relief so to keep this  
simple for the calculation and to be conservative 
I'm going to keep the main rate at 25% so you'll  
be paying 25,000 in corporation tax as you can see 
it might make sense to start off as a soul Trader  
early on so you can utilize the tax-free income 
allowance and the lower income tax brackets but  
the tax bracket after a certain threshold very 
quickly becomes much higher for a soul Trader  
than the highest bracket for a corporation tax so 
with that in mind it might make sense to consider  
switching because you could save a significant 
amount of taxes after a certain rate the other  
thing to consider is as a soul Trader you get 
some other tax benefits for instance first year  
losses can be used to reduce any other tax that 
is due that year so you might even get a refund  
but at the same time with a limited company you 
can write off more things as expenses so you're  
lowering your profit and subsequently lowering 
the tax that you owe I'm not going to go into  
a lot of detail in this video because it's 
very case specific but I did want to flag it  
as something that is important for you to look at 
when you're choosing between the two structures  
then let's move on to protection and privacy when 
it comes to a soul Trader you your business are  
considered the same legally this means that you 
are responsible for all of your businesses debt  
and liabilities if the business can't pay its 
debts your personal assets like your home or  
your car can be used to cover the cost and pay 
it off in the same way your business name is  
not protected either which means that any other 
person can trade under the same name as you and  
you can't legally prevent them from using it in 
their business so this isn't really a big deal  
when you're starting out but as you get bigger 
and you scale it can be an issue and you want to  
avoid you you don't want other customers mixing 
your and another business up with each other so  
that is something to consider although this is 
different to a registered trademark if you want  
to register trademark you'll need to apply for 
that separately if it's relevant to your business  
if you are operating as a company and the company 
is the legal entity then you're splitting up your  
personal assets and your business assets so if 
something happens to your business they can't  
then go after your personal assets your car your 
home your personal assets they're protected again  
there are some exceptions in this case as well for 
instance if you have signed a personal guarantee  
for a business loan or if you failed to meet 
certain direct duties then you as an individual  
could still be held personally liable so it's not 
a complete clear cut here the drawback however of  
a limited company is that it comes with less 
privacy if you have a limited company you are  
required to file accounts and other relevant 
documents with company's house and then once  
these documents are filed they become part of the 
public record and anyone can access it so everyone  
can access or can see how your company's doing 
your financial performance details about your  
company structure it's all available to the 
public and that might not be something that  
everyone wants when starting out the final thing 
that I'd like to say is that after reaching a  
certain level transitioning from a sold Trader to 
a limited company becomes less of an option and  
more of a necessity because as you grow operating 
as a company carries a specific brand image it  
generally implies that the business is robust it's 
stable it's managed responsibly because there are  
specific rules and regulations that have to come 
into place when you're operating as a company so  
that just gives confidence to customers it gives 
confidence to suppliers and potentially investors  
as well if you're looking to scale and go down 
the funding route later on which you can't do as  
a soul Trader so those are some of the key things 
to consider when deciding what to set up your  
business as and in most cases the soul Trader 
way is the way to go when you're starting out  
and then you want to transition to a limited 
company at the right time if you enjoy this

vJ6vkIaay4o,"I've spent nearly a decade navigating the world 
of finance and Banking and I've seen firsthand  
the mistakes people are making day in and day 
out that are stopping them from becoming rich so  
in this video I wanted to share with you five of 
the most commonly overlooked bad habits and tips  
on how to break out of them number one a scarcity 
mindset there's this really interesting study done  
with a group of relatively low achieving students 
they were split into two groups the first group  
was the control group and that group was asked to 
together read out loud an article describing how  
human memory works and then later discuss what 
they learned so they learned about long-term  
short-term memory using repetition the second 
group was taught about a growth mindset so they  
read and discussed an article about how learning 
makes their brain smarter and discussed how they  
can apply their learnings in their school work 
what they found was the second group who learned  
about the growth mindset showed a significant 
increase and effort and motivation towards their  
learning compared to the first group and this 
increased motivation had a direct correlation  
to improved performance so the students tracked 
the results of math tests for both of these groups  
after a year of doing the exercise and the 
group that was taught about memory continued  
to see their grades decline whereas the group 
that learned about the growth mindset saw the  
reverse their grades started to improve it's so 
easy to blame external things for why we're not  
good at something oh my teacher wasn't very good 
at teaching that I don't have the experience in  
it I don't have the right skills to be able to do 
something and I'm guilty of this myself but the  
act of reframing your mind set to one that is 
of abundance and growth just making that shift  
it really is the thing that changes your life's 
trajectory and what you're able to achieve every  
single person that I know that has acquired a lot 
of wealth has this in common an abundance mindset  
and the belief that they can do it knowing that 
something is possible makes you much more likely  
to go for it and to put in the work to achieve it 
than if you think something is Out Of Reach and  
success or financial wealth is something that is 
reserved for other people number two skimping on  
growth this is something that I did a lot in my 
20s and it's only in the last few years that my  
perspective in paying for education has completely 
changed because before I had this mentality that  
everything is available on the internet for free 
so why should I pay for further education or  
learning when I could just take the time out to 
learn those things myself without having to pay  
for it so when I started my YouTube channel I 
had no understanding or background in anything  
creative I didn't know how to work a camera let 
alone anything about editing or social media and  
at the start of my YouTube Journey I'll spend days 
hours weeks on end trying to figure out one small  
thing and how it works I remember wanting to make 
the color grading of my videos look a bit sharper  
and Polished and I watched another YouTube video 
on how to do it and I think it was Joshua mayor's  
on how he edits his videos because I love the way 
his videos looked really high production and so I  
just tried to copy it I tried to copy what he did 
not realizing that that video was for people who  
actually have some sort of basic understanding 
of how an editing tool works and so I tried my  
best I got it completely wrong and for week my 
YouTube videos looked like they were recorded  
in the ' 80s in a black and white scale and I 
couldn't figure out how to fix it what I should  
have done was just buy a course that would teach 
me how to edit from a to zed and I don't want this  
to sound disingenuous because of course here I am 
on YouTube selling courses now suddenly talking  
about how courses are important and it sounds 
typical but I can honestly say that in the past  
year the biggest category that I've spent money on 
after all my needs have been met is courses I even  
bought a course that's helped me with my social 
skills and that is the level of which I pay for  
Learning and Development now everything you want 
to learn or anything you want to solve or any  
part of you that you want to develop don't skimp 
out on it because it's only going to cost you in  
other ways and to really grow and build wealth 
you need to keep investing in your learning and  
education number three doing it all yourself I 
saw a motivational quote the other day that read  
Beyonce has the same 24 hours in the day that we 
do great quote except it missed the fact that our  
24 hours aren't the same and she has the ability 
to Outsource pretty much everything that she could  
possibly think of and she has a team to run it 
all although we definitely don't have the same  
24 hours that she does we can however find ways to 
achieve more in less time because you don't have  
to do everything yourself anymore and for almost 
everything I've realized that there is some sort  
of free tool or system that can help you do the 
thing that you need to faster and better that  
brings me very nicely to a tool that I use on a 
daily basis and that is Grammarly who are very  
kindly sponsoring today's video according to a 
report by forbs we spend on average 88% of our  
work week communicating and written communication 
takes up the largest amount of time in that so  
whether it's writing a persuasive email writing 
an important document preparing a presentation or  
a pitch written communication plays a huge part 
in every aspect of our working lives and so the  
ability to do it well and to do it fast can be an

grammarly.com/nischa next we have relying on 
being physically present there's a quote from  
Warren Buffett that goes if you don't find a way 
to make money while you sleep you will work until  
you die it's a bit extreme but it's true the whole 
idea is that to Achieve Financial Independence or  
Financial Freedom which is ultimately what so many 
of us strive for we need to create systems or have  
Investments That generate income without the need 
for us having to continue to work this concept is  
very different from what most of us are familiar 
with we're used to thinking that we need to spend  
40 Years of Our Lives working and then rely on our 
retirement funds to live out the remaining years  
but instead of going down that route if we could 
look at our active income sources and think how  
can I turn this into something that won't require 
me to be physically present or at least not so  
involved in 5 or 10 years time then that is a way 
we can start thinking about how to make our money  
work for us whilst we sleep now at the start of 
your career this is a lot harder to do and most  
if not all sources of income require either a 
lot of time or a lot of money but then after  
that depending on how you play your cars and what 
you focus on after the initial stages that will  
then dictate your path to financial Independence 
when it comes to running a business for instance  
a really good book that I recently reread for 
the second time is the emth Revisited which  
talks about how if you don't set up the systems 
in your business you you're always going to be  
working for money and needing to be physically 
present when it comes to investing Buffett's  
investment philosophy is centered around the idea 
of buying and holding a diversified portfolio of  
high quality companies that can grow over time 
effectively making money without the need for  
constant involvement with the income sources that 
are coming into your life right now think about  
how can I use this as leverage to set myself 
up in a way where I don't need to rely on being  
physically present to have that income coming 
in number five the garden hose there think of  
your attention and energy like a garden hose when 
the nozzle is tightly controlled and directed at  
a single point the water flow is really strong and 
it can effectively nurture the plant it's aimed at  
over time that is like focusing your energy on a 
few selected tasks it leads to effective results  
and productive outcomes if you start poking 
holes along the hose to water multiple plants  
at once the water pressure drops the more holes 
you add the weaker the stream becomes for each  
task until eventually there's not enough water 
pressure to be useful for any of the plants and  
that's the equivalent of saying yes to too many 
commitments your energy and attention get spread  
too thin and nothing gets the full focus and needs 
to actually Thrive with so many opportunities out  
of fingertips so many new ideas so many things 
to try it's tempting to say yes to everything  
that comes our way thinking that if we don't do 
everything we're going to miss out but really  
doing this will just slow us down you don't need 
to grasp every single opportunity that comes your  
way you don't need to try 100 things all at once 
in the hope that one of them picks up it's a lot  
more important to have specific strategic Focus so 
those are five things that you need to stop doing  
to become rich this year thanks for watching if 
you enjoyed these videos you'll enjoy this video

YgWdoT3SBNU,"Thank you to Hubspot for sponsoring this video. I 
have spent the last two years learning about every  
productivity and time management tip that exists 
and in this video I wanted to share with you four  
of the most life-changing ones that I've learned 
these include both evidence-based strategies and  
ones that I've personally discovered and it's a 
reason why I was able to run this YouTube channel  
alongside a full-time job still have time to learn 
new skills to travel and have somewhat of a social  
life let's get into it number one efficiency 
tracking this is possibly the single most  
effective thing you can do for your productivity 
what I used to do was work for 8 10 12 hours a  
day and tell myself that by putting in more hours 
I was being more productive and I thought I was  
getting a lot done because I was constantly 
occupied then when the end of the day came up  
and I looked at my to-do list what I set out to do 
at the start and what I actually accomplished were  
Mars apart and I couldn't understand why I'd 
look at everyone around me accomplishing all  
these great things and I can barely get through 
my five bullet point to-do list of 20 minute  
tasks where was I going wrong like you I've also 
watched back-to-back videos on productivity read  
books on it articles looked into the research and 
one of the simplest things that came up a lot but  
I kept ignoring because of how mundane it seemed 
was tracking my time in the act of just doing this  
for one week tracking how exactly I'm spending my 
time on every single task was a thing that made me  
realize working for 2 hours does not mean I've 
got 2 hours of that work done what it did mean  
is that I spent 20 minutes checking my emails 10 
minutes switching between applications 5 minutes  
quickly replying to WhatsApp messages just by 
taking the time out and tracking exactly how  
I'm spending my time on any given task really 
gave me Clarity on how much productive work I  
was doing versus what's distracting me and what 
I need to cut out I used clockify to track my  
time it can give you a report at the end of the 
week you can also do this through Excel using a  
pen and paper whatever method you use I promise 
you this will save you hours of lost productivity  
before I get into the rest of the video over 
76% of people who watch my videos are not not  
yet subscribed if you're part of that 24% then 
thank you for helping me out if you're part of  
the 76% please can you do me a favor and hit 
the Subscribe button it really helps out the  
channel and it helps me continue to provide free 
content number two aligning 20% of your work there  
is this concept that Marcus Buckingham who is a 
career expert talks about and he says to look at  
your career in terms of red threads everyone's 
job is made up of loads of different colors of  
threads red black brown green whatever and these 
different threads signify by different activities  
different people tasks situations some of them 
we don't enjoy but some of them we do and the  
ones that we do we can look at as the red threads 
these are the tasks or the things that we work on  
that we love that Inspire us and that makes us 
feel alive everyone's is different but everyone  
has these red threads in their working lives 
now what I found really interesting is that  
he says you don't need to have a full red quilt 
to be happy and fulfilled if just 20% of your  
job involves activities that youy enjoy this can 
significantly impact your motivation fulfillment  
and therefore productivity with just 20% you're 
more driven you're more focused more aligned with  
what you do and even if you reach 30 or 40% the 
difference isn't that much greater but when you  
drop below 20% there's almost a linear relation 
between doing less of what you love and increased  
risk of burnout so the very first thing you want 
to do is identify what exactly those red threads  
are for you and think about how you can weave them 
into the rest of your career because those are the  
things that will ignite you and inspire you and if 
you don't add them into the rest of your career no  
one else is going to take responsibility for it 
when it comes to the non- red task I also try to  
think of ways to make them more enjoyable one of 
the ways I do that is by listening to different  
music genres at different times of the day and I 
picked up this technique from a free guide on how  
to be more productive at work that was on hopspot 
the guide is full of evidence-based productivity  
hacks designed to help you achieve more in less 
time it's packed with practical tips and tricks  
tools that are backed by research and science so 
you know that they work the guide tells you not  
to listen to music at certain times of the day 
because it can actually have the opposite effect  
it can be distracting and for me especially in 
the morning when my focus is already sharp I  
don't need background music but for other times 
in the day it recommends organizing your Spotify  
playlist by genre and mood so you can easily find 
the right soundtrack for whatever your workday is  
another interesting thing it mentions on page 13 
is this concept called toggle tax which refers to  
the time lost when constantly switching between 
applications and that can cost you up to 4 hours  
per week and then I'll will tell you tips on how 
to handle this what tools you can use and how to  
prioritize tasks and projects more efficiently 
if you're looking for ways to be more productive  
and efficient with your time I highly recommend 
checking out this free guide on Hubspot completely  
free doesn't cost you anything thing and you'll 
pick up something that you can Implement straight  
away the link is in the description and thank you 
to HubSpot for sponsoring today's video number  
three the decision rule in a research study which 
I'll linked below psychologist explored the reason  
that impacted whether or not a judge will prove 
a criminal to be released from prison on parole  
researchers looked at over 1,000 rulings over 
a 10-month period and what you think would be  
the case that the judge's decision depends on 
the type of crime or the type of law what they  
actually found was something very different and it 
was at the time of day that that ruling was held  
had one of the biggest impacts on their decision 
at the beginning of the day a judge was likely to  
give a favorable ruling about 65% of the time but 
as the morning wore on and the judge became more  
drained from making more decisions the likelihood 
of a criminal getting a favorable ruling steadily  
dropped to zero this is essentially what decision 
fatigue is the idea that after making a lot of  
decisions your ability to make more and more 
over the course of the day becomes worse when  
your willpower is fading and your brain is 
tired of making decisions it's easier just  
to say no and to keep everyone in prison than it 
is to debate whether or not they should be able  
to leave decision fatigue happens every day in 
your life as well the more small decisions you  
make the less willpower you have as the day goes 
on and understanding this properly had led me to  
change a lot of the actions I did earlier on so 
the most obvious and visible one for you guys is  
what I choose to wear when I record my YouTube 
video I promise I wear other colors but I have  
about five tops that I wear for my YouTube 
videos and they're all black so it doesn't  
require me to sit there and think about what I'm 
going to wear or have to make any decision on my  
side I set that low expectation from the start 
and it made a huge difference on me just turning  
up and creating content over and over again the 
way one of my friends applies this She lays out  
her clothes for the next day the night before 
so that's one less decision she needs to make  
in the morning and number four what would this 
look like if it were fun this is an idea that  
I got from the book Feelgood productivity and 
I absolutely love it the whole concept of this  
book is that the way to be productive and to be 
in your most productive state is to love what  
you do and structure your work in a way that 
you enjoy the process and this is a completely  
different spin on the standard Hustle culture 
that we usually hear about so the way I apply  
this on the days that I have a lot of admin to 
do and I've been putting it off for weeks on end  
I would now look at Tas and think what can I do 
to make this process fun for me sometimes it's  
transforming an EXL spreadsheet into something 
that's really aesthetic pleasing colorcoded has  
some difficult formulas in it and makes me feel 
intellectually stimulated or it's working from a  
new local coffee shop or working with some 
friends together and having planned breaks  
think about how you can turn what you need to do 
into a bit of an experience and an adventure and  
I just cannot recommend this enough whenever 
I'm feeling a bit drained or not motivated to  
do something taking myself out of my normal 
working routine is just the thing I need to  
feel inclined and to move to get things done there 
are loads of other productivity and mindset shift  
hacks all back to my research in the book and 
if you want productivity to be a part of your  
life for the long run rather than just something 
that comes in spikes definitely check this out  
I'll leave a link to it in the description as 
well below talking of productivity if you want  
more and you want tour around my workspace and 
how I set it up to be in my optimal Flow State  
check out this video over here and if you want 
some more productivity habits that save me 20  
plus hours a week this video right here is for

n_dXKbHEog8,"should I buy a used car or a new one how
many years old how can I lower my
insurance costs what's the best way to
calculate the total cost of ownership
most of us are massively overpaying for
our car and so in this video I thought
it would be helpful to highlight four of
the most important money things you need
to know before buying along with tips on
how you can reduce the cost of having a
car over the long run before we dive
into this video 75% of people who watch
my videos are not yet subscribed which
is outrageously high if you're one of
those silent viewers please do me a
favor and hit the Subscribe button it
helps me continue creating and putting
out free content and improving my videos
along the way let's get into it the age
old question exists when it comes to
buying a car should I buy new or should
I buy used on one hand a new car comes
with several benefits not only is it
more shiny and nicer to drive but it's
also seen as more reliable and safer
plus they usually come with a warranty
and if you time it right you can get a
good discount on the car for instance
March and September are busy car buying
periods in the UK because that's when
new number plates are introduced unless
these cars get sold in September or in
early October they tend to sit around
and depreciate and any leftovers will be
at a lower price by the end of the year
and that's also when car dealers still
have sale targets to fulfill so it's a
great time to negotiate the downside
however is that even after negotiating
and timing this right buying a new car
is often still the less financially
Savvy option and statistics show that
after the first 12 months a new car can
depreciate by around 15 to 35% and that
depreciation keeps going up to 50% or
more over 3 years on the other hand
buying a used car can save you a lot of
money in the long run and The Sweet Spot
for used cars is usually between 3 to 5
years old at that point the car has
depreciated substantially at someone
else's expense and will depreciate
slower in the years that you have it the
downside however is that used cars may
need more maintenance and repairs
because it comes with wear and tear from
previous owners and this can really add
up over time but I come to some of my
favorite tips on how to offset those
costs later in the video number two
factor in the all-in price you can have
two people buy the same car at the same
time but pay very different amounts for
it purely down to the way they bought
the car the most common ways to buy a
new car in the UK is to buy an outright
hire a purchase or a bank loan a lease
or a PCP and depend depending on which
one you choose it can cost you thousands
more or thousands less to give you a
high level overview on what each of them
are the outright way involves paying the
full price of the car on day one so you
don't have to worry about any payments
or interest going forward what you see
when it comes to the car price itself is
what you get the second way is to buy a
car through finance and in the UK if
you're buying it through the car
dealership this is often referred to as
higher purchase and with this you pay a
deposit for the car or a lump sum at the
start and then you borrow the amount
that's left at a set interest rate for a
certain number of years so if you're
taking out the financing for 3 years
you'll pay the monthly payments for that
car over the 3 years until the car is
fully paid off you can also opt for the
straight personal bank loan in this
option and the rates you get through
this are typically lower than what you
get through a higher purchase through a
car dealership the third option is
leasing a car this is similar to renting
you make monthly payments to use the car
and then you return it at the end of
your contract with this option you're
only paying for the car's depreciation
during the time that you have it not its
full value so you provide your initial
deposit and then the car dealership will
look at how much they think that car is
going to depreciate during the time that
you own it say 10K over the 3 years that
you owe it then they divide that into
monthly payments and add some fees and a
bit of interest on top the fourth option
is the PCP and with this you decide your
deposit amount that you want to pay up
run the dealership provides a value or
an assigned value on what they think the
car will be worth at the end of your
contract ra and then both of those
figures are added together and
subtracted from the cost of the car and
what's left is divided into monthly
payments when the contract ends you can
either return the car you can use that
final assigned value to part exchange
the car or you can pay for that assigned
value assuming it's still what the car
is worth to keep the car the total cost
depends on which of these financing
options you choose the length of the
contract the amount of your deposit and
which car dealership you go for the
price can vary between dealerships
because some of them can offer greater
discounts or contributions than other so
it's worth shopping around I've created
a video explaining exactly in detail how
to calculate this cost with the real
examples using an Audi A3 and I will
link that over here if you are
interested in this type of content and
you're looking for more money tips and
practical lessons that you can use
straight away I have a newsletter where
I share some of my best tips I go into a
lot more detail on some of the topics
that I cover on my YouTube channel and I
also share a lot of hacks that I don't
talk about on social media if you're
interested it's completely 100% free and
you can find the link in the description
third thing to consider is Insurance
costs Insurance costs are often ignored
when we're budgeting for a car you go
through the whole car buying process you
decide what car you're buying and then
you look at the insurance cost and you
think ah didn't budget for that the good
news is that you can get some good deals
depending on your driving history the
car you're buying where you live and
what insurance provider you're going for
couple of tips firstly shop around not
just when you first get their insurance
for a car but every year after that
whenever it's time to renew it costs an
insurance provider more to lose you than
it does to keep you so tell them you've
looked around you found competitors
offering the same cover but for Less
give examples of what other providers
are offering and at what price and use
that to negotiate your cover down and
the fourth thing to look out for is
maintenance and repairs the average used
car driver spends around
£1,300 annually on car repairs and
maintenance this number includes petrol
repairs and breakdowns two tips to keep
the repair cost low firstly know that
you have other options Beyond just going
to a car dealership when it comes to
maintenance whilst yeah some premium car
owners may prefer to have the car
serviced at the dealership and only at
the dealership it's worth knowing that
local garages can often provide a very
high quality service at a much lower
cost and if you're still concerned about
the reliability and the quality of
service that you can get from local
garages you can opt for an authorized
garage from the car manufacturer these
garages are often staffed by mechanics
who seen as just as skilled as those in
the dealership but without the added
cost the second option you could do
which is becoming more and more popular
is the do it yourself option because you
can find the answer to anything on
Google I'm not going to recommend this
because I would be hopeless but if you
prefer to watch a YouTube video on how
to fix something or how to change the
oil in your car you can save money or
it'll cost you more depending on your
DIY capabilities those are four common
things to look for and consider when
buying and running your car if you want
to know about the different financing
methods in more detail I've a video over
here that you could check out and if you
want to know about how much car you can
afford depending on your salary then
this video right here is for you thank
you for watching and see you in one of
that"
WS8OZ8hv1mY,"I'm flying back from Dubai to London on
not just an ordinary flight but on a
7-hour journey that I've decided to turn
into the highest return on investment
flights I have ever taken the aim is to
land on the other side having done a
deep dive analysis on my finances for
the year I also decide to give vlogging
a try only to realize very quickly that
this is not my calling luckily the
primary focus of this channel is finance
and that's what you're here for I'm
going to meet my partner at the airport
fortunately I managed to stag a last
minute free upgrade through points
unfortunately because we booked
separately his seat didn't get the same
luxury before you ask if I ditched him
on purpose it was due to the auto
upgrade features on the Emirates app
once settled into the business Lounge I
need to download a Year's worth of
financial data ready for analysis I log
into the online banking system for each
of my bank providers downloading the
last 12 months worth of transactions
from each bank account either through a
CSV file or a PDF file depending on the
technological capabilities of the bank
in previous years I have automated this
path to review my finances this year I'm
going for the more manual but mindful
route I send all the PDF files onto my
iPad which I'll be using to do a
crosschecking later on I treat myself to
some readily peeled light cheese
something that would have been the
ultimate luxury growing up and an ice
cream to go I get onto the fly and take
a few more pointless videos and then get
straight into it first step get all my
CSV files into the same format my first
column is all about dates the day each
transaction went down this is written in
UK format of course date month and then
year second column is the reference slth
description I don't know what half of
these means so I'm going to have to do
some digging in section two the third
and the fourth column is the paid in and
paid out these can either be combined
into a single column or split into
separate ones I keep them separate so
it's easy to tally up at the bottom if I
want to I also make a fifth column and
name it as category we will fill that
out in the next stage key tip here do
not over complicate it that is where
most people trip up after realizing I'm
not yet done with this tedious task and
that I've store got to include the
remaining transactions from the PDF
statements I order a glass of champagne
to drown my sorrows I go through each
statement Page by page and type out the
information into the format I have in my
main Excel spreadsheet Crossing them off
so that I'm not tempted to enter my
income in twice as nice as that would be
now I've got all the information I need
from the last 12 months in one place in
one format the reason why the annual
review is so effective is because it
includes all the one-off costs that you
would easily forget on a monthly budget
things like a roof repair or a one-off
present that you buy there's no hiding
when you do the annual review everything
is trackable and everything is out in
the open so here's what I do next I dive
into the list of expenses and give each
cost a good hard look as I'm doing this
I'd rename each of them in the reference
column using my own words something that
makes sense to me so I know exactly what
that purchase is for by doing this
you'll find a lot of things that you
didn't even know you were spending on
you'll see that you're Auto enrolling
for subscriptions and renewals that you
don't even use anymore and you'll find a
lot of Errors pretty quickly for
instance you return something in one
month but you don't see the return in
any subsequent months whenever things
like this come up I will just highlight
it so that I can action it at the third
stage of this annual review then in the
column next to it I'd label each
spending as either fundamental fun or
future fundamental costs are like your
loyal friends that stick by you through
and through these are your basic needs
that you need to pay pay for to survive
things like your food groceries
transportation and bills fun costs are
friends that may not be loyal but they
bring the fun into your life so this
includes things like travel eating out
the rounds of drinks that you regret
buying on that night out and then the
future MOS are the friends that lift you
up and support you in the long run this
includes the savings your retirement
contributions and your Investments and
that's where I'd like to introduce the
sponsor of today's video which is
trading 2 on two it lets you invest in
stocks index funds ETFs and user made
portfolios and I've been using them for
over five years years to manage a
portion of my portfolio they recently
added multicurrency accounts so if
you're invested in this US Stock Market
for instance which is where a large
number of the biggest companies are you
don't then have to pay huge foreign
exchange fees and now you can also earn
5% on your GBP balance 5.1% on your US
dollar balance and 4.2% on your Euro

this point I have a quick lunch break
white cloth glass plates metal Cutlery
good food but as good as it seems which
is why I W it down my Consciousness
takes over and I make my way to the
lower deck to swap seats with my partner
and let him enjoy the high life for the
second half of the flight on to the
final step when it comes to this last
stage this is where you review all of
your finances and really analyze where
your money is going you want to think of
yourself as the CEO of your finances so
in simple terms you would look at how
much you're making how much you're
spending and whether your spending is
consciously done in a way that brings
you happiness or whether you're just
doing it mindlessly let's start with how
much you're making if you're employed
this probably doesn't come as a surprise
to you you know how much you're making
month but month but if you're
self-employed this can be a real eye
opener when I was doing it there were
some income streams that I thought I was
making a lot more on and I really wasn't
making much at all and some that I
thought I wasn't making anything on but
I was making a decent amount so this
really helped me understand where I'm
going to focus on this year in terms of
spending I first look at it as a very
high level approach initially and then I
go into a more detail so on a high level
basis I say okay how much of my
take-home pay am I spending towards each
of these categories how much of my
take-home pay is going towards my
fundamental cost recommended guideline
for that is 50 to 60% I look at how much
of my take on pay is going towards my
fun spending recommended guideline for
that is 20 to 30% and then I look at how
much is going towards my savings and
investment recommended guine it's 10 to
20% I'm trying to get that even higher
I've got a few things I want to buy in
the next year which I'm coming to in a
second so I'm going to increase that
even more this year then on the stage
you look through each of these
categories and question why you've made
the purchases that you've had and
whether it's the most cost effective way
to go or not so again some of the things
that I came across I was spending a lot
of money on Ubers and taxis every month
at first glance I thought I should cut
this back but then I analyzed it and I
thought I don't own a car and so when I
compare the cost of what owning a car
would be versus how much I'm spending on
taxis and public transportation it's
actually Justified and far more cost
effective to go down for myself to go
down the taxi route and or public
transportation route so for that reason
I don't feel like I need to make any
changes here another thing I noticed was
that my hyper optic Wi-Fi Bill rolled
over onto a monthly contract and it went
up to £ 35 and it went up from £35 to
£54 so I gave them a call to ask them to
go back to the yearly contract and that
five minute call saved me £200 when it
comes to the fund cost I look at how
much I'm spending in terms of Happiness
levels and whether I should ditch some
of the things I spent on and instead
replace it with other spending habits
this year there was some spending that I
dismissed when it came to the monthly
budgeting because I just thought oh it's
a oneoff I don't really need to analyze
that or reduce it going forward when you
see how much you're spending on things
on a yearly basis relative to other
costs that you have you start to rethink
some of your choices previously you
might have just dismissed and thought
it's a one-off cost on on a monthly
basis but when you look get it in
perspective with other costs you might
think okay actually I need to change
some of these things around and I'm
happy to cut back here to spend more on
that finally analyzing the future cost
this is about thinking of your finances
in a strategic way that aligns with your
future so think about where you want to
be in one year or in 5 years time and
are you putting enough towards the
future cost to get to that point so when
I was looking at leaving my job and go
all in on entrepreneurship my focus was
to make sure I could keep my emergency
fund or top up my emergency fund as as
much as I can so everything I was saving
for the year before that was channeled
into making that emergency fund as big
as I can in the next 5 years I like to
buy my forever home so that is now
something I'm focusing on saving towards
you can do this review at any point in
the year you can do it quarterly you can
do it every six months you can do it
yearly and but I really do recommend it
it's a complete Game Changer when you're
analyzing your finances and if you're
someone who can't keep up with a monthly
budget tracker you don't need to do it
month on month as long as you've done it
one off and you know exactly where your
spending has gone from from a year that
is good enough so I hope you enjoy this
if you do try it and analyze your
spending over the Year let me know how
it goes thank you for watching and see
you next week"
Np04DGs4zDc,"after spending 9 years in Investment Banking 
I decided to leave my job last year to pursue  
entrepreneurship full-time do I regret it has 
it been worth it will I go back into banking  
people love these days to dismiss the idea 
of working for someone else without having  
done it themselves instead I wanted to give you 
a balanced view a very honest view on the things  
you should consider and the things that I wish 
someone else had warned me of before I made the  
decision to quit number one you're trading the 9-5 
for the 24/7 you would have heard the saying do a  
job you love and you'll never work a day in your 
life while on the surface this sounds believable  
and it sounds like a dream the reality is very 
different and the idea of never working a day  
in your life just does not exist when the thing 
that you love becomes your primary income stream  
the things you enjoy stop being as enjoyable when 
you include money into the mix when I was working  
full-time and doing my creative stuff on the 
side I loved the creative stuff I didn't have  
any pressure to make money from it so the boring 
stuff that came with making money so working with  
sponsors chasing invoices bookkeeping none of that 
existed but when I left my full-time job all of  
the other things that come with monetizing your 
passion made the Creator stuff less enjoyable I  
still love it a 100 times more than what I used 
to do but don't go into business or becoming an  
entrepreneur thinking that it won't feel like 
work because you love it there will always be  
parts of what you do that you don't enjoy and 
when it's your own thing and you're starting out  
and your income is tied to what you're doing and 
how much you're doing your work life balance also  
goes out the window evenings are no longer a thing 
weekends are no longer a thing you'd rather miss  
that dinner out with some friends just to buy back 
some time to get that project that you're working  
on off the ground whereas when you're working for 
someone else you know that you are going to get  
paid rain or shine if I left work at 5:00 p.m. 
and didn't log in for the rest of the day if I  
took two months of annual leave that month I was 
still going to make money number two no one tells  
you what to do this can be a good thing and a 
bad thing as an employee I knew what to expect  
I knew what project I was going to be working on 
I knew what I had to do I had someone giving me  
feedback on whether I'm doing well or how I need 
to improve or if I didn't know how to do something  
there's a 99% chance that someone else in the 
organization knew how to do it and I could just  
call them up and figure it out I had someone give 
me instructions on how to operate in the Working  
World some people love that it's one less thing to 
think about but you're not going to get that as an  
entrepreneur and in business very often the only 
way to find an answer is to live through it for me  
that is so much more exciting yes I can read some 
books yes I can give someone a call and get some  
advice but I only really know if something's going 
to work if I do it myself and that forces you to  
try different things and continuously challenge 
yourself the personal growth for me in the last  
year of working for myself has been far greater 
than it was in the 9 years prior of having someone  
else tell me what to do and how to do it number 
three the fear of competition the structure for  
employees is for them to go to work for a certain 
number of hours and get paid for those hours the  
fear comes from when you may no longer be needed 
anymore or someone else enters your sere with  
better experience or better skills or someone 
who is cheaper to employ comes in to do what  
you're doing and you lose your job as a result of 
that and I've seen that happen to so many people  
you really feel it or at least I did when I was 
in the workplace because of this you find that  
people you're working with don't want to share 
all their information they don't want to teach you  
everything they know because they want to protect 
their own position and I totally see that side but  
when you're in business it's the complete opposite 
you speak to another entrepreneur and they know  
the grind and the hustle that you're going through 
and you'll sit there for hours telling each other  
everything you know there is no such thing as 
direct competition or if you're doing it then  
they can't one person doing well isn't going to 
put the next person out and you can all learn from  
each other for me this has been a really big shift 
and it's really surprising to see how openly the  
entrepreneurs and the creators have come across 
speak and share their numbers or how much they've  
made on a certain Thing versus how secretive 
people were when they're working for a company  
which leads me to my next Point money this one is 
huge and it can completely dictate your view on  
whether you think working for yourself is better 
or working for someone else is better to give you  
an idea over the N9 years that I worked in banking 
I got a 5 to 10% raise on most years zero in one  
year and then a 30% or around 30% when I switched 
companies I have video over here on what my salary  
was like year on year for the last 9 years in 
banking and you can see the full breakdown and  
where the biggest pay increases came from the good 
thing about working for someone else is that there  
is a flaw I'm not going to get paid less than my 
base salary that year the bad thing is that there  
is a cap I can't make more than a certain amount 
even if I had a really good year it didn't mean I  
was going to make more money I can't suddenly 
make triple what I did the year before just  
because I added so much value and brought in a lot 
of Revenue it just doesn't work like that for most  
jobs jobs whereas as an entrepreneur there is no 
cap zero restrictions what you make is a direct  
correlation between the value you provide and 
the money you make if you get it right you can  
go from zero to 100 in a year again speaking 
from experience I made more after one year as  
an entrepreneur than I was making after 9 years 
in banking but that number as an entrepreneur  
can go down to zero just as easily as it went up 
to 100 so there is pressure to constantly be on  
your aame but for me there is nothing better 
than being in full control and ownership and  
how much I'm going to make and not have someone 
come to me at the end of the year and tell me oh  
the economy isn't doing well or the budgets have 
tightened and so we can't pay you as much none  
of that it's all within my control then value 
and ownership my job was to provide financing  
for corporates and governments for projects that 
created jobs and supported the economy I can make  
that sound as fancy as I want and make it sound 
like I'm contributing to people's lives but there  
was absolutely nothing unique that I was doing or 
contributing that someone else couldn't have done  
and when I left someone else did step into my 
job and do what I did almost instantly I did a  
Handover they had similar skills they took over 
they got the job done now the way I contribute  
to people's lives is through what I've created 
yes it's the knowledge and the skills that I've  
learned from others and the experience I've gained 
through banking it's also an extension of me and  
my view and my perspective on things if I don't 
do it no one else can step in and take over they  
had their own version sure but the satisfaction of 
creating something unique something that can't be  
replicated because you've infused your perspective 
and your personality with it that's huge I  
feel like by doing this I'm tapping into my core 
strengths and my skills and what I was meant to do  
which isn't something that I had the opportunity 
to do in banking when I was working for someone  
else I do believe that everyone has something 
like that there are 8 billion people in the  
world and none of us Shar the exact same DNA there 
is something that makes you authentically you and  
there's something that you can do that no one else 
can compl compete with and that gave me a sense of  
ownership and fulfillment that I knew no other 
job could give me then freedom and control this  
for me is the one thing that I will never be able 
to give up now that I've had a taste of it I have  
the freedom and the full control of how I work 
what I work on where I work from how efficient I  
am how hard I work for how long I work for again 
good and bad but the good and something that I  
could have only dreamt of doing before is that I 
can take my laptop and go to Barley for a month  
and work from there I can on a zoom call wearing 
a t-shirt or a jumper and still be respected and  
that probably sounds so irrelevant and minor but 
when you've lived a certain institutionalized way  
for 9 years you really appreciate these things 
and Community this is a huge one that I really  
do miss I used to work with hundreds of people I'd 
be speaking to 10 20 people a day would be working  
on things together would get large together i' 
meet people from different backgrounds who I would  
never hang out with outside of work but we would 
have great conversations when we were in work  
and that is something that does not exist in the 
early stages of being an entrepreneur you don't  
have that Community fi day in and day out but you 
do have a full say on who you work with you don't  
need to work with Karen from Finance if you don't 
like her you don't need to have to hear from John  
illegal because you don't agree on things you 
can choose to work with who you want to and if  
it's not working you can work with someone else 
so again there are positives and negatives in it  
but I do enjoy not having to go into work with 
a fake smile because there's a 360 feedback or  
a performance review coming up I could just be 
myself all in all on a whole I have not looked  
back there are times or things that I miss having 
when I worked for someone else but after I weigh  
up the pros and cons it's just a no-brainer that 
I'm so much more happier and fulfilled doing what  
I'm doing now but that's my story someone else can 
tell you that they have had the worst experience  
working for themselves and they would way rather 
live a comfortable life as an employee either way  
I wanted to give you a balanced view from someone 
who has worked for someone else for 9 years but  
also has the experience in working for myself for 
now thank you so much for watching if you like  
this video here is the other video I spoke about 
on how much I made every single year over my 9year  
Span in banking and also this video right here on 
why I quit thanks for watching and see you there"
a9SFmR1cK4o,"I began my career making £335,000 working at 
a top tier Investment Bank in London I didn't  
save a single penny that year I lived paycheck to 
paycheck month on month and I remember thinking  
at the time life would be so different if I was 
making six figures I'd be able to buy so much  
more I'd have enough left over to save and I 
won't feel like I'm broke but why is it that  
26% of people in the UK making 100,000 plus 
said that they had no money left at the end  
of the month and over half of Americans earning 
more than 100,000 are living paycheck to paycheck  
and why after making my first 100,000 was it so 
different to what I expected now I know where I  
went wrong and in this video I wanted to share 
with you three reasons why so many high earners  
still feel like they're broke and how you can in 
fact feel rich at any income level point one the  
income versus living cost dilemma there is a quote 
in the book The 4-Hour Work week that reads people  
don't want to be millionaires they just want to 
experience what they believe only Millions can can  
buy a big part of feeling rich is driven by how 
far the money you earn can stretch you how much  
it can buy you essentially what is the value of 
every pound or dollar that you make in relation  
to where you live for instance someone making 
a 100,000 in a high cost of living area where  
their basic living costs alone make up 80% of 
their take-home pay is going to feel a lot less  
Rich than someone who is making the same amount 
but their basic living costs only make up 30% of  
their take-home pay the second person has over 
three times more left over to spend every month  
on the things that they love now some of that is 
purely our own fault I mean no sympathy here for  
anyone who is living paycheck to paycheck on a 
sixf figure salary because their basic living  
costs include a penthouse and a G wagon that's 
another story but I'm talking about the bit that  
it's harder to control especially when a lot of 
these high-income jobs are based around high cost  
of living areas if you're trying to break into 
the entertainment industry then you might be  
thinking to relocate to LA or if you want to 
work in Tech then San Fran or Silicon Valley  
are places you might be considering for the best 
options or if you want to work in a well-paid job  
in finance then you might be considering London 
or New York but the issue with living in these  
areas is that it takes a lot more money to live a 
decent lifestyle than it would in other parts of  
the country in fact if we only look at incomes 
London households make about 15% more than the  
rest of the country but almost all of that premium 
is completely wiped out by housing costs London is  
becoming less affordable for firsttime buyers 
and it's taking up a bigger percentage of net  
household income and according to a statement in 
the Ft when you take that into account a household  
in London is no better off than the national 
average the difference between income and the  
living cost in these cities show that having 
a high salary does not automatically translate  
into feeling Rich maybe the answer to considering 
a job in a high living cost area is living outside  
of that Hub it might come at the cost of a longer 
commute but if it means a Countryside home with a  
bigger garden and a golden retriever rather than 
a two-bedroom flat with a cat it might well be  
worth it or if your job isn't location dependent 
then working remotely either working at home for  
a few days of the week it saves you on the commute 
cost and all the other cost that come with being  
in the office or shifting to a new lowcost country 
altogether if you can work entirely remotely Point  
number two the Doro effect the Doro effect is a 
phenomenon that happens when you buy something  
new and that new item leads to a chain reaction 
of you buying more and more new things to either  
go with the first thing that you bought or to 
keep up with it for instance your living room  
looks perfectly fine but you decide to upgrade 
your sofa on the wiim you want to buy a new one  
now when that comes you're rug in comparison looks 
a bit old it looks a bit dated so you also buy a  
new one and then your lamp as well and then your 
curtains and you might as well buy a new house Al  
together essentially the D effect is one of the 
reasons why some people might become rich but  
never be wealthy they're trapped into the cycle 
of earning upgrading earning more upgrading and  
it's especially apparent when you buy something 
that might change your social group for example  
you move to a new house in a more expensive 
neighborhood with Rich neighbors who have  
nice cars in that case you might feel the need to 
upgrade yours so it doesn't look like a complete  
Banger in comparison although it's virtually 
impossible to not want or feel the need to  
upgrade your life if you're making more money you 
don't want those upgrades to completely erode the  
entire rise or the increase that you're getting 
because as rewarding as it might be at the time it  
removes any potential for extra savings and then 
you're just trapped in a cycle where you're living  
paycheck to paycheck and not really Building 
Wealth and worse there are some things that once  
you upgrade it's very hard to go back business 
class fights a bigger home sending your kids to  
extra classes or activities and once you're used 
to it it can mess with your long-term savings and  
financial stability so now you know that this is 
a thing and that's the first step being aware that  
you're doing it the second thing you can do is 
save in terms of percentages of take-home pay so  
instead of putting say $500 equivalent into your 
savings account every month take a percentage of  
your income out of your paycheck so when you make 
more you will automatically save more because that  
extra percentage that you're saving and investing 
every time you get a pay rise is what's going to  
help you build long-term wealth and feel rich 
in a way that a high salary alone won't be able  
to point three the inevitable but the legally 
avoidable many high-paying jobs require some  
sort of higher education or degree in the first 
place which comes with a cost the cost is having  
to spend years paying off that student loan 
when I went to University the tuition fee for  
an undergraduate degree in the UK was £3,000 per 
year using the inflation calcul data index that  
£3,000 is equivalent to £4,200 today but tution 
fees are actually around £9,250 a year so if  
you're doing a 5-year degree you're looking at 
graduating with a debt of £50,000 minimum before  
even starting your career and these deductions 
in your paycheck doesn't just end with education  
so when I was making £120,000 a year which is 
a lot of money I don't discount that whatsoever  
47,000 of that went straight to tax and National 
Insurance when you couple for that were the fact  
that a I chose to live in London and B I got 
sucked into Point 2 and upgraded my car with  
my very first paycheck and was paying that off 
for a while the six figures definitely didn't  
make me feel rich in a way that I thought it 
would have before I achieved it when you earn  
a salary it's hard to avoid this the deductions 
are always going to happen but there are a few  
ways you can keep more of what you make in your 
own pocket firstly optimize your contributions  
to your workplace pension most employers offer a 
match contribution which means for every pound or  
dollar that you put in they will also match that 
for every pound or dollar and that gets put away  
into your pension before the tax man gets hold of 
it and make sure you are claiming your additional  
tax relief if you are a higher rate taxpayer 
other things you can do at any income level is  
firstly make sure your tax code is correct and 
that your deductions are correct because these  
cost you money if they're wrong and secondly make 
use of all the tax incentives that the government  
is encouraging there are tax breaks when it comes 
to making choices that are more green tax breaks  
for investing in taxfree investment accounts 
or operating under a company and deducting your  
expenses these are all tax breaks so you can keep 
more of what you make whilst also doing what the  
government is incentivizing you to do one of the 
tax-free investment accounts I use is Trading 212  
they let you trade stocks index funds ETFs user 
made portfolios one of my favorite features is  
their pie aspect where you can publish your own 
portfolio or look at other people's most popular  
portfolio and copy what they are investing in 
as well you can see the most popular portfolios  
depending on the categories that you're interested 
in so whether the focus is on ETF dividends growth  
stocks if you want to create your own portfolio 
you can search for the asset say bonds gold Global  
Equity Funds and you could put whatever percentage 
of allocation you want to contribute towards it  
say 70% 20% 10% and then you can see based on 
your savings what the value will be over time  
you can also earn 5% interest on your uninvested 
pounds and also earn interest on other currencies

Rich isn't about making a lot of money it's about 
being smart with what you have and managing it in  
a way that lets you experience the things that 
you think earning a lot of money would buy you  
whilst Building Wealth alongside that even if 
you're not remotely close to six figures you're  
probably doing a lot better than you think and I 
have a video right here on four signs that you're  
doing well financially even if it doesn't feel 
like it thanks for watching and see you there"
UZBCddcbX0I,"when it comes to Payday it's hard to know what 
to do with your money you get paid and before  
you know it your bank account is at zero again 
if you're new here I'm Nischa I'm a qualified  
accountant with 9 years of experience working in 
banking and in this video I wanted to walk you  
through the eight things you need to do as soon as 
you get paid the very first thing you want to do  
is know your reference point that is Step number 
one there is something called the ostrich effect  
which is a cognitive bias that causes people to 
avoid any information that can make them feel  
sort of discomfort they would rather act like 
that information didn't exist this is maybe why  
you rather not check your bank account after a big 
night out or you'd avoid looking and facing your  
debt but this idea of just bearing your head in 
the sand when it comes to your finances is a big  
part of why a third of the UK and 64% of the 
US population lives paycheck to paycheck the  
solution isn't as hard as what people make it 
out to be calculate exactly what you spend on  
housing groceries Transportation Insurance over 
over the next month as well as any other costs  
that make up your essential living expenses next 
you want to figure out how much of that makes up  
your total net income you can do this using your 
own method if you want to use a free template that  
I use there's one Linked In the description so 
you list out all the costs in the First Column  
that says fundamentals and add your net income 
at the top and then this cell to the right in  
this box here is a number you need to know that 
number now becomes your reference point it's what  
you're going to come back to in the next step 
and and in step five the guideline is to keep  
that number below 60% of your net income again 
this sale will tell you where you're at if it's  
over go through each of the items and think about 
whether you can reduce it maybe if you're living  
in a two-bedroom flat you can rent out your 
spare room or whether you can swap it for a  
cheaper alternative maybe you don't actually need 
50 GB of data on your phone contract knowing your  
reference point helps you immediately move on to 
step two the quick solution fund being good with  
money involves two things first is understanding 
the basics the basic math part second is often  
overlooked it's the psychological aspect sometimes 
even if the numbers suggest one choice the best  
choice might actually be the one that makes you 
feel more comfortable this idea is important both  
for this step and for step seven imagine the 
psychological comfort of knowing that even if  
your car breaks down if your boiler fails or if 
you need Urgent health Care it will all be taken  
care of you don't have to go into debt to pay for 
these emergencies that is what the benefit of a  
solution fund is the psychological comfort 
and the peace of mind just from having this  
fund tucked away somewhere and knowing you can get 
access to it that's hard to quantify the aim is to  
take the total of your one month living expenses 
that you calculated in step one and save them in  
a solution fund save it in a place where you can 
get high interest and as easy to access when you  
get to one month of expenses you can pause there 
it isn't necessary to build up a fully fledged  
3 to 6 month emergency fund at this point instead 
we are now going to focus on the most mathematical  
sensible approach which leads US directly onto 
step three what's better than buying something  
now and not having to pay for it months or years 
down the line the answer is not overpaying for  
it let me explain in the UK the average credit 
card debt per person is just over £1,200 and  
in the US it's just over $5,700 we use debt to 
buy everything from clothes gifts Furniture if  
you're not paying it off you're overpaying if you 
pay for an iPhone with your credit card which has  
a 22% interest rate then that £1,000 or $1,000 
iPhone isn't costing you $1,000 anymore after  
a year it would have cost you $1,220 that is $220 
more than what you should have paid so if you have  
high interest debt instead of keeping it taken by 
and separately working on building a savings fund  
what you want to do instead is cancel them out 
use your savings to pay off your debt you might  
be thinking how does that make sense everywhere 
you hear it's about saving and I'm telling you  
to use your savings to pay off your debt well 
debt usually costs more than savings earn if  
you have 1,000 sitting in your savings account 
earning 5% a year after one year you would have  
made 1,050 essentially you're $170 worse off than 
if you had used that money to pay off your high  
interest debt instead so what's the best way to 
approach this step one list out all the debt that  
you have that has an interest rate of above 7 
or 8% step two decide how you're going to pay  
off whether you're going to use a snowball or the 
Avalanche method the snowball is the psychological  
optimal route simply put it means paying off the 
smallest of your loans as quickly as possible and  
once that debt is paid you take the money that 
was used for that payment onto the next smallest  
debt the idea of this is that once you see that 
you're able to pay off a loan and you have that  
under your belt you have the motivation to keep 
going but there are times where the additional  
time and the additional money investment of the 
strategy doesn't make sense and that's when the  
Avalanche method comes in Instead This focuses 
on paying off the loan with the highest interest  
rate First Once the highest interest debt is paid 
you put that money towards the account with the  
next highest interest rate and then the next one 
and so on until you're done step three use your  
savings to focus that debt in the order of which 
you chose a little side note here depending on how  
much you're saving and where you're located the 
interest through your savings can also be taxed  
that makes the benefit of using extra savings to 
continue and stay at this step rather than saving  
it even more Justified now you have a little 
more freedom to do what you want but first  
let's move on to step four this has come in lower 
on my less than you would see on other personal  
finance channels and the reason for that is that 
it essentially involves sacrificing your current  
disposable income for a future pay increase in 
my opinion there's no point in planning for your  
financial future if your present finances aren't 
even in order and so only once the last step is  
complete then you should focus on employer match 
retirement contributions in most countries you  
have to opt into this plan and call your HR 
department to get you enrolled in the UK by  
default you're automatically enrolled into your 
workplace pension scheme 10% of people choose to  
opt out if you're in that 10% I'm hoping is to 
do one of the steps above if it isn't then you  
can focus on this step until you've maximized 
all the benefits it's worth making use of this  
for two reasons firstly it's free money from your 
employer that typically matches your contributions  
up to a certain percentage of your net income 
for example if you contribute 5% of your net  
income your employer will match that 5% you 
can continue this until you've received the  
full match you don't need to go any further 
at this point the second reason why this is  
a great option is that it reduces your taxable 
income this year and this isn't something that  
you can back dat you can't use your last year's 
allowance this year so if you don't use it up if  
you don't use that employer matching contribution 
this year you've lost it whilst taking this step  
in you should also begin saving 3 to 6 months 
worth of your essential living costs that same  
amount that you calculated in step one and you 
do this to build out an emergency fund this fund  
it's a big bigger safety net for you to fall back 
on those bigger unexpected but inevitable life  
shocks if you lose your job you don't want to be 
worrying about how you're going to pay your bills  
or being forced to take on the first available 
job that comes at you just so you can make ends  
meet in most cases you will be fine for 3 months 
of your living cost purely your living cost but  
if you're in a higher risk industry with a lot 
of layoffs or if you're self-employed with an  
unsteady income then 6 to 9 months is even better 
step six your Roi people have different views on  
how they should allocate their money between step 
six and step seven my view is that the easiest way  
to make more money is through getting a pay rise 
or through starting a side hustle and to do this  
you need to invest in your own return in your 
skill set in your knowledge in the extra value  
that you can bring the extra money that you can 
bring on the side or through a pay rise can then  
be invested into the next steps in the order 
that I discuss them the reason why I've done  
it in this order is because if you focus on step 
seven or step eight first first that journey to  
wealth becomes more prolonged the best solution 
if you can afford to do it is to choose to do them  
alongside each other if you have enough money to 
do them both alongside each other then that's the  
option when you want to go because by starting 
early with investing you're on the right side  
of the curve when it comes to compounding and the 
exponential growth you can have when time is on  
your side is life-changing so the first thing 
to do is make sure you're fully utilizing any  
tax-free accounts that are available to you so for 
instance a Roth IRA if you're in the US or if in  
the UK there are different types of ISAs the one 
I'm referring to more specifically is the stocks  
and shares Isa I've linked some of my favorite 
in the description below including trading 212  
which lets you start investing for as little as 
one pound trading 212 lets you invest in stocks  
index funds ETFs and user made portfolios and if 
you're in the UK it lets you do it through an Isa  
so the money you make through capital gains and 
dividends is taxfree what I like about trading 212  
is that it's one of the most innovative platforms 
available they were one of the first to introduce  
fractional shares and now with their most recent 
announcements you can also earn interest on your  
uninvested cash so that's currently 5% on your 
GBP balance 5.1% on your US dollar balance and  
4.2% on your Euro balance and this is paid daily 
and there's no limitations to the amount that  
you can hold uninvested so whether you're ready 
to start investing at this step or you want to  
start maximizing your earnings on your uninvested 
cash you can check out Trading 212 and two and  
get a free share worth up to 100 by verifying your 
account and making a minimum deposit of1 and then  
using the promo code Nischa n through the menu bar 
step eight the opportunity cost when it comes to  
investing additional income there is always an 
opportunity cost in how you decide to allocate  
that money and what you could have done with that 
money instead but really it comes down to what  
you want to prioritize and how you want to carve 
out your life and at this point some people might  
think that the best option is to fully pay down 
their mortgage and live in their house completely  
debt free without any stress this means they 
have the freedom to go part-time and start a side  
hustle or a business that they've always wanted 
to it can mean they could travel for an extended  
period of time without worrying about mortgage 
payments or it might mean fully paying off your  
student loan so you can take some rests and choose 
a different career path other people might find it  
a better option to continue investing in things 
like private Equity peer-to-peer lending and  
also making use of taxable investment accounts 
What do you do here there's no right or wrong  
when it comes to this step it's about using the 
additional income you have in a way that fits  
your risk appetite your income category and the 
vision that you have for your life that's how I  
allocate my money on payday if you want to get 
started with step one then this video over here  
covers everything from how much you should 
be spending on the different categories to  
the tools and techniques you can use when it comes 
to managing your finances if you found this video  
useful I would love for you to subscribe over 70% 
of people who watch my channel have not subscribed  
and it would mean the world to me thank you so 
much for watching and see you in the next video"
7gk52Oc8fqs,"Saving a lot of money in a short amount of time is 
not easy on one hand we're fighting The increased  
cost of accommodation food clothing and on the 
other we're battling everyday Temptation in a  
world where pretty much anything can be bought 
with a single click in fact the data shows that  
61% of adults in the US are living paycheck 
to paycheck and 34% of adults living in the  
UK have less than £1,000 in a savings account so 
in this video I wanted to walk you through four  
effective strategies that will simplify and fast 
track your saving process if you're new here I'm  
Nischa I'm a qualified accountant and on this 
channel we discuss all things personal finance  
and self-development new videos come out every 
single week let's get into it the very first thing  
I want to talk about is Parkinson's law and this 
is a concept that was coined in the 1950s and in  
simple terms it means that your work will expand 
to fill the time that you allocate to doing it  
for instance if I set myself 3 weeks to plan and 
release this video it will take me 3 weeks I'll  
procr resonate I'll come across something new and 
go down a rabbit hole watching different videos  
on that topic I'll find a way to make that work 
expand to take up the full 3 weeks whereas if I  
give myself 48 hours to release this video I'll 
find creative ways to get it done and very likely  
the quality between the two videos wouldn't be 
too different this same principle can be applied  
to personal finance where the resource instead 
of time is money your spending will expand to  
consume all available funds if you let yourself 
spend all of your net income you'll find a way  
to do it but if you take away 10% as soon as 
it hits your bank account on payday and put it  
into another savings account that you can't touch 
you'll find a way to make that remaining 90% work  
and if you think putting 10% away is doable try 
20% and living on the remaining 80% try 30% and  
living on the remaining 70% you'll be surprised 
by what you can do and you might be listening to  
this thinking that's ridiculous no way can I make 
this work that's where the fourth saving strategy  
I talk about comes in where I go into more detail 
on how you can make this work with what you have  
the second saving strategy is to not be a last 
minute person when I worked in my corporate job  
during the busy weeks and months I would get a 
takeout about three to four times a week I'll be  
on my way home it'll be late I'll be hungry and 
on my way home I'll just order something from  
deliver or Uber Eats so that it's ready for when 
I got home and I did this week after week because  
I didn't take a few hours out on a Sunday to meal 
prep and think about a healthier solution for the  
week instead I'm still guilty of sometimes doing 
this but planning in advance can save you a lot of  
money it will save you in overdrive fees because 
you're setting up some time to check your bank  
account it will save you in Uber costs or taxi 
costs because you've saved yourself enough time  
to get public transport instead and planning 
in advance also gives you options to do better  
you can use your reward points to book your next 
flight you can get a good quality umbrella instead  
of waiting until you're caught in the rain to 
buy whatever is available there are times when  
last minute flexibility is useful but often it 
costs you money and limits you with options the  
third saving Str strategy is to utilize saving 
technology with almost every habit that we want  
to stick to or want to try there is some sort of 
technology that will help make it easier for us  
if you're trying to reduce your social media 
consumption there are apps like one sec that  
forces you to take a deep breath before opening 
the app giving you a second or two to rethink your  
decision if you want to improve your Fitness there 
are apps that will help you do that and in the  
same way if your focus is to save more money you 
want to lean into the technology that's available  
to help you out with that there are apps that 
calculate how much you can afford to save each  
week and then automatically moves money into a 
separate savings account or an investment account  
there are accounts like Plum if you're in the UK 
which analyzes your spending to work out how much  
you can afford to save and then it automatically 
transfers the money over every four or five days  
you can also through that round up purchases to 
the nearest pound and then save the difference so  
for instance if you're spending 130 it will round 
that up to2 and then you can automatically save  
the remaining 70p if you want to check out Plum I 
have the link for that in my description you want  
to find the right apps or the right technology 
that will help you align your habits to your  
goals and make the process of saving a lot easier 
the fourth point which is arguably the one that  
will really make a difference if you stick to it 
is doing a year in review at the end of each year  
we usually do a full evaluation on other areas in 
our lives we look at what went well what didn't  
how we can learn and improve for the following 
year a great way to save a lot of money in a short  
amount of time is by doing the same evaluation 
in detail top to bottom with your finances this  
is different to a monthly budget which I have 
a whole different video for and a free tracker  
that comes with it I'll leave a link to that here 
but think of this monthly budget as you rowing the  
boat you're moving forward month by month whereas 
a yearly review is you stepping back to check the  
broader Horizon checking that you're not just 
moving forward but you're also moving in the  
right direction so once a year I'll consolidate 
all of the bank accounts that I have my debit  
card accounts my credit card accounts into one 
one main tracker that money will have all the  
money coming out of my account I'll categorize my 
spending and then go through each category line by  
line asking myself three questions can I cut this 
out or cancel it completely can I live with less  
of it or can I get the same thing cheaper from 
somewhere else I'm not going to [ __ ] you this  
isn't fun it's not interesting but you only need 
to go through this once a year but the ROI from  
this exercise and just carving out 6 to seven 
hours to do it is so worth it I gave myself 7  
hours to do it last month on a flight back to the 
UK I've recorded my entire process I don't know  
if it'll be useful or just a boring video but if 
you want to see it let me know and I'll show you  
how I went about analyzing the numbers and the 
data one thing that has really helped me analyze  
data as well as develop a bunch of other skills 
is brilliant.org who are very kindly sponsoring

aBV_YapUgBE,"as I plann my goals for this year I
wanted to walk you through exactly how
you can set goals that you will actually
achieve the first thing you want to do
is attach a so that I can to the goal
let's take the goal of reading more a
vague statement like I want to read more
it's not very helpful because a it's not
specific so you wouldn't really know
where to start or what to do to achieve
it and secondly it's not connected to a
reason and that has a huge impact on the
motivational element of it let's change
that goal around and redefine it to I
want to read 30 non-fiction books by the
end of this year so that I can increase
my knowledge and be able to talk to
others about various topics now not only
have you made it specific but you've
also attached a personal meaning to it"
ADx1TiaRkNg,"for nearly a decade I was caught in an endless 
cycle each year would begin with a burst of energy  
and ambition Grand goals and dreams only to have 
forgotten about them 3 months later ultimately  
time and time again I would end the year in 
exactly the same place that I had started  
but last year I decided to try a completely new 
approach to setting goals I used evidence-based  
strategies implemented advice for some of the best 
experts on the subject and analyze case studies on  
what works and what is simply a waste of time and 
by the end of year I had hit every single goal so  
as I plan my goals for this year I wanted to walk 
you through exactly what this new approach is  
and how you can set goals that you will actually 
achieve the first thing you want to do is attach  
a so that I can to the goal let's take the goal 
of reading more a vague statement like I want  
to read more it's not very helpful because a it's 
not specific so you wouldn't really know where to  
start or what to do to achieve it and secondly 
it's not connected to a reason and that has a  
huge impact on the motivational element of it 
let's change that goal around and redefine it  
to I want to read 30 non-fiction books by the end 
of this year so that I can increase my knowledge  
and be able to talk to others about various topics 
now not only have you made it specific so you know  
exactly what to do and what you're working towards 
but you've also attached a personal meaning to it  
it makes you so much more motivated and inclined 
to work on that goal the same goes for money  
rather than thinking I want to make more money 
how about writing down I want to generate 10K in  
passive income by December so that I could look 
to retire early and spend more time doing things  
I love or so that I don't need to worry about how 
much the bill is going to be when I'm out with my  
friends or if I'm on Holiday by doing this you've 
created a personal connection to it once you've  
thought about a specific goal and attached a 
meaning to it the first thing you want to do  
is write it down and research shows that there is 
a correlation between writing down your goal and  
earning more in 1979 Harvard MBA graduates they 
were asked about their goal setting habits and  
the different approach that graduates took had 
a huge impact on how much they earned later on  
in their life so 84% had no specific goals 133% 
had goals but they hadn't written them down and  
only 3% had both written down the goals and had 
a plan to achieve them 10 years later those same  
people were surveyed again so the 133% who had 
goals even though they hadn't written them down  
they were earning on average twice as much as the 
84% who had no goals at all but most impressively  
the 3% who had written down their goals and had 
come up with a clear action plan on how they're  
going to achieve them were earning more than the 
combined income of the other 97% so this clearly  
illustrates the importance of writing your goals 
down but to take it one step further another study  
that was done in 2015 by Dr Gail Matthews to test 
the findings from the Harvard study confirmed two  
things firstly that the same results if you 
write your goals down you're likely to earn  
more and Achieve those goals but the second thing 
that that study found is that by adding another  
step into your goal setting process it increases 
the chance of success even further I'll come on  
to what that extra step is in just a second but 
first aim to take two to three big goals you have  
and write them down you don't want any more than 
three goals any more than that and they are just  
a distraction and remember these goals are things 
that you'll be working on on top of the everyday  
things that you have going on in your life so keep 
it small and keep it focused then you want to take  
those big one-year goals and restructure them 
with deadlines so to explain this a bit further  
there is something in Psychology called delayed 
discounting this is that people tend to Value  
immediate rewards more than future rewards even if 
the future reward is a lot bigger this is why you  
scroll through social media rather than working 
on a side hustle this is why you crave in and  
eat chocolate instead of choosing a healthy 
salad well I do when you apply this concept  
to oneyear goals you can see why it's incredibly 
challenging to stay motivated when you're working  
with a time frame that is so far in the distance 
there's virtually zero incentive so the aim then  
is to break that goal up and bring parts of it 
forward so for instance instead of saying I'll  
say 5,000 by the end of the year what about having 
the goal I'll say 500 by the end of this month the  
former is easy to put off because it doesn't seem 
urgent but the latter is a lot more immediate so  
you want to take action straight away according 
to the book The 12we Year the author recommends  
breaking down your one- year goal into a 12we plan 
so the idea is to think of the 12 weeks as a year  
so now 12 weeks represent a year every week now 
represents a month and every day represents a week  
when you think of it like this you think about how 
important every day is to hit your goals this 12we  
plan it's proven to be the perfect Sweet Spot 
which is long enough to see progress and make  
any changes but short enough to create a sense 
of urgency so if your goal this year is to make  
10K and passive income break this down into what 
you need to achieve in the next 12 weeks to feel  
like you're on track maybe it's okay I'm going 
to buy one rental investment property in the  
next 12 weeks 12 weeks that shorter time frame 
makes the goal feel immediate and it makes you  
want to take action straight away I first read the 
12we year 2 years ago when I started changing my  
approach to goal setting and I wanted to refresh 
my memory and take away the key bits again and I  
did that through reading the summary on short 
form who are very kindly sponsoring this video  
short form is an incredible web app for reading 
in-depth book summaries so it provides a onepage  
of summary for each book and then it also gives 
you super detailed chapter summaries as well and  
the thing that I love most about short form is 
that when it gives you a summary for a book it  
also includes Snippets from other books and other 
articles that provides evidence either supporting  
what the author is saying or challenging it and 
making you think from a different perspective  
short form has also introduced a new AI feature 
so you can download the extension to your browser  
and at a click of a button it will give you a 
summary of any video any blog any article that  
you come across and then we'll also give you 
recommended books to further your learning on  
that topic it's such a good way to enhance your 
learning on any topic within minutes if you want

you do enjoy it and go want to go ahead with

have a compelling vision and a plan most people  
think that this is enough they sit back and they 
wait for everything to happen to them and for the  
universe to to give them their Vision but the 
universe only responds to what you do not what  
you think about that's where KPI tracking comes 
in think of KPIs as outputs so bringing back the  
goal you had of buying one investment property 
in the next 12 weeks what are the KPIs that you  
can use to inevitably hit that goal it can be I'm 
going to drive around my local neighborhood every  
day this week to see what is coming available 
in the area it could be I'm going to visit 10  
houses this week and put in at least three offers 
it can be I'm going to call five estate agents and  
build relationships or go for a coffee with them 
and find out what's coming up in the pipeline by  
doing this and outlining the actions you're going 
to take every single week it will inevitably lead  
you to your goal it's a kpis you want to spend 
your time focusing on not on your goal the best  
bit about using this 12-week plan guideline is 
that it compresses what you would have achieved  
in a year into 3 months and then you have 
the chance to change the path every 3 months  
instead of wasting a whole year on something that 
doesn't work out for example if your one property  
goal doesn't pan out in the first 12 weeks and 
you think this it actually doesn't put me on the  
right track then you can spend the next 3 weeks 
focusing on something else that will move you  
closer to the one-year goal there's one final 
thing that has proved to take your goal setting  
process even further in the 2015 study by Dr Gail 
Matthews 267 participants were divided into five  
groups so the first three groups were the same as 
the one in the harbor study I spoke about earlier  
the first group had no goal the second group 
had a goal but no no plan to achieve it and  
the third group had a written goal with a plan 
he also introduced two more groups into this  
the fourth group had the goals with the plan 
and sent these to a supportive friend and then  
the fifth group had the goals with the plan and 
sent these to a supportive friend together with  
a weekly progress reports and results show that 
the fifth group who did everything and also had  
a friend to hold them accountable accomplished so 
much more than all of the other groups so the way  
I apply I have a whiteboard in my office and at 
the top I write down my main goal for the year  
and the why that's attached to it below I'll 
have my 12we goal and then below that I have  
what I'm going to do every single week to get me 
closer to that 12we goal so I have a list of the  
actions that I'm going to take that week and then 
tick them off as I go through it and then at the  
end of every week so every Friday I'll sit down 
with someone in my team and we go through that  
list I tell them what I've ticked off and what I 
haven't and why I haven't for me there's something  
that doesn't feel good when you go to someone else 
and you say yeah I didn't achieve my goals because  
I was lazy I wasn't feeling motivated I can be 
bothered so even if I have to work all day all  
night on Thursday I always show up on Friday not 
having everything ticked off for that week so that  
is how I'm setting my goals for this year if you 
like this video you may also enjoy another video  
that I have on here on habits that have made me 
more productive and make me stay focused to hit  
the goals that I've set out for myself I'll 
link it over here and I hope to see you there"
xnpy2RRkD6I,"this is a photo of me from 3 years ago I
was always tired I had no energy I felt
unfulfilled and like I was so far away
from where I wanted to be in the months
that followed I listened to hundreds of
podcast episodes read even more books
took courses to develop different skills
and had multiple conversations with
people who were at the top of the game
so in this video I wanted to share with
you five of the most life-changing
mindset shifts that I learned through it
all and how you can apply them to your
life this year number one the law of
sacrifice Newton's third law states that
for every action there is an equal and
opposite reaction so in simple terms
when an object pushes another object it
gets pushed back in the opposite
direction equally as hard so think about
how birds fly they use their wings which
push the air down but because every
action has an equal and opposite
reaction the air pushes the bird up at
the same time although this is in
relation to the law of motion we can use
this physics and apply it to the law of
sacrifice the law sacrifice suggests you
can't get something you want without
giving up something in return and there
aren't any shortcuts to it in order to
get something you believe is of a
greater value you must give up something
you believe is of a great value whether
it's your time your energy resources or
any other Pursuits every goal we Chase
demands something in return that we need
to give up so for instance if you want
to take your side hustle seriously
whilst having a full-time job you can't
complain that it hasn't worked out for
you if you're only devoting two days a
month to it whilst maintaining your
social life going out all the time
seeing your friends all the time it will
take sacrificing your social life to a
certain extent to be able to get what
you perceive as a better value so now
whenever I want something I look at all
the things that I need to give up and
the sacrifices I need to make to pursue
that thing if it's worth trying I will
make those sacrifices but if I'm not
willing to make those sacrifices then I
can't expect to get that thing number
two keep it simple in almost all aspects
of Life finances businesses energy
understanding the principle that 20% of
causes drives 80% of outcomes can put
you way ahead and if you can grasp and
apply this concept from the start you'll
be ahead of 99% of people because most
people over complicate things they think
we need to know every single thing
before taking action we need to know
every single fact every single piece of
information all the data before making a
decision so let's take a step back and
look at it in terms of a business the
three key numbers you need to pay
attention to are your Revenue cost and
your net profit those are the three
numbers that I will look out on a
monthly basis and only if something is
massively off amongst one of these three
or something hasn't gone to plan or it
looks unusual will I then dig deeper and
look into each of these in more detail
but if I analyzed a fully fledged profit
and loss statement every week I can
easily get caught up in the numbers and
not see the wood from the trees and
understand what is the bigger picture
and what am I trying to do here the same
goes with your personal finance we think
that there is so much to it but really
the three numbers you need to know know
are what percentage of my income am I
saving what percentage am I investing
and what percentage am I paying towards
my housing and transportation those are
the three key numbers you need to know
to then make a difference on the rest of
your life but most people don't even
have a clue about what those three are
so keep it simple you don't need to have
a fully fledged bar chart tables
thousands of numbers all the time you
just need to be aware of the 20% that
drives the 80% the third thing I've
learned is that when making decisions
listen to the 8-year-old in you and the
80-year-old you so when I was making the
decision to quit my day job in
Investment Banking I had a million
different things running through my head
who is this going to impact what am I
going to do what happens if I fail what
if I can't even cover my basic need
costs and then I took a step back and I
asked myself at this present time does
the 80-year-old in me and the 8-year-old
in me approve of the decision that I'm
about to make when putting yourself in
the shoes of the 80-year-old in you
you're asking yourself will I regret it
if I try or will I regret it if I don't
try we've seen the research that shows
that one of the biggest regrets of the
dying is not doing something they regret
not having the conversation not having
taken that rest not spending more time
doing something rather than something
that they did on the other side the
8-year-old in you reminds you to have
fun along the way that life doesn't need
to be so serious all the time and that
you don't need to put so much pressure
on yourself to have to get everything
right so now to break through the limit
I put on myself or the limits I think
other people are putting on me I make
decisions that my future self and my
8-year-old self will approve of the next
most important thing that I've learned
is that understanding none of it really
means anything there's a quote that I
came across that is climb the greatest
Mountain achieve all the accolades in
the world become the greatest in your
field achieve fame earn millions and you
will enjoy every bit of your journey if
and only if you understand that none of
it means anything sadly or maybe not
sadly and actually for good reason
nothing is permanent and I've learned
that if you keep anchoring your identity
to what you do instead of why you do it
you start to create this false sense of
importance and attachment to her and
pitting your self worth and building
attachment to something that can be
taken away is a pretty dangerous
territory to be in so applying this to
what I do now instead of anchoring my
identity to the fact that I have a
social media presence I would anchor it
to why I love doing what I do which is
taking complicated stuff simplifying it
making it accessible the universe can't
take that away from me it can take away
my social media presence but it can't
take away the bit that I love doing the
same way maybe if you work in a clinic
as a pharmacist or a dentist for example
it may be that the bit that you love the
most is the human touch of what you do
that is the part of your identity that
you can Embrace through the other things
that you may want to try out that bit is
something that the Universe can't take
away from you when you do this and and
anchor your identity on what you love
you realize that nothing owns you you
can learn to enjoy and love the phase
that you're in whilst also being okay to
walk away and move on to the next
chapter whenever that time comes when
you stop learning you're going backwards
one important thing I've learned is that
when we stop learning we don't just stop
moving forwards we actually start moving
backwards we regress because everything
around us keeps changing and growing so
if you don't change and grow too we're
actually falling behind and this lack of
progress and improve ment and personal
development gradually sets us back as
well as learning through books podcast
people one of the ways I've continued
learning is through using brilliant.org

Nisha so those are some of the lessons
that I've learned this year that have
had a huge impact on the last year and
that I'll continue taking on with me
into the next year thank you for
watching and see you next
year"
bRxZYqtlZjw,"as the year draws to a close many of us
look back and can't help but feel a
sense of time slipping through our
fingers you might be wondering where did
the year go why didn't I achieve all my
financial goals but the good news is
that it's not too late to make the most
out of this year think of these final
weeks as a perfect opportunity for a
financial research so in this video
we're diving into the end of year annual
money checklist I'm going to start with
a high level overview on what you should
be aiming for when it comes to your
finances and then go into some of the
key areas in more detail for each of
these steps I'm going to give you some
action points to tick off and tell you
how long you should be spending on each
of these items whilst reviewing it on
your checklist let's jump straight in
with the bigger picture and that is to
evaluate the percentages of your three
FS the three FS as I've referred to in
other videos are your fundamental costs
your future U costs and your fun costs
the idea is to go through your spending
and sort it into these three buckets the
first bucket is the fundamental cost
which ideally should hold 50 to 60% of
your net income that's your income after
paying taxes the lower that percentage
for this bucket the better think of this
bucket as the essentials for your basic
needs including your expenses like
mortgage or rent utility bills groceries
if you notice this bucket overflowing
exceeding that 60% Mark it's assigned to
look for ways to trim down these
expenses so whether it's putting a spare
room on Airbnb if you own your place or
looking for ways to earn more to reduce
the proportion of your total net income
that are devoted to these fundamental
costs effectively managing this first
bucket is key and by keeping it within
the recommended limit you free up more
of your budget for the other two buckets
the second is a future U bucket the
guideline for this is 10 to 20% of your
net income should be going towards this
this is the money you're spending on
savings and Investments and you can
allocate it differently depending on
what your priority is but the more you
could allocate towards this bucket the
better if you're not getting to the
lower end of the range think about what
changes you can make to hit that 10%
finally we have the fun bucket this is
where all your fun spending goes
subscriptions dining out Leisure or
entertainment the recommended guideline
for this bucket is 20 to 30% of your net
income if you're spending Beyond this
limit it might be time to reassess can
you cut back on for example any of the
subscriptions you use are there less
expensive ways to enjoy your leisure
time so action point check your spending
and percentages for each of these
buckets and decide how going to make
changes to stay within those recommended
guidelines or do better time allocated
to spend on this 3 hours of focused
energy the tracker that I use to do this
is linked below completely for free
super easy to use most of my spending is
already categorized through the bank
accounts that I use and then I
consolidate it using that tracker one of
the accounts that I used to categorize
my spending since 2016 is a revolute who
I'm very excited to say are sponsoring
today's video Revue has helped me stay
on track with my goals and my spending
but it's also helped to maximize the
amount of value I get from the spending
in my fund bucket particularly when it
comes to travel it's a no-brainer you
can withdraw money from 55,000 in
network ATMs for no fee and if you want
to exchange currency then the FX fees as
well are very low I have the personal
account I've had this for years and I
now also use the business account I've
got the Premium plan because it includes
travel insurance discounted airport
lounge access discounted International
money transfers and also cash back for
so many other things that I already pay
for like no sh and Squarespace Revue is
available in the US in the UK as well as
a bunch of other countries you can check
if it's available for you using the link
below and the benefits go Way Beyond
just travel if you're in the US you can
be a non-resident as well and still
access all the benefits if you want to
check out link is in the description now
working our way down the checklist next
second review the size and the location
of your solution fund one of the first
things to do in personal finance and the
thing to set up before you look at doing
anything else is to build an emergency
fund or a solution fund which is what
I've seen it referred to as recently
it's essentially a safety net in case
anything goes wrong and you have any
unexpected expenses you have a health
scare you lose your job this gives you
that peace of mind that you can deal
with the situation without going into
debt the aim is to have 3 to 6 months of
your living expenses saved in your
emergency fund if you are employed and 6
to 9 months of your living expenses if
you're self-employed so action point is
firstly reflect on your emergency fund
are you halfway there are you just
starting out if you're building up how
much are you going to save every month
to build it to the amount that you want
it to be and secondly where are you
saving your emergency fund make sure
it's saved in an account which is easy
to access but you're also making
interest on time to spend to complete
this exercise maximum 30 minutes this
doesn't take too long number three
negotiate your bills down most companies
offer competitive introductory rates and
then they increase those rates after the
first year or two so you may have signed
signed up for for example a specific car
insurance because it was the cheapest at
the time but then fast forward 2 years
and now you're paying more than the
average many people don't realize that
they can often negotiate their bails
down so action point here is to contact
your service providers so this includes
your mobile contract broadband service
car insurance Bank fees check that
you're actually getting the best value
for what you're paying if not ask lower
them see if there are any promotions
discounts or cheaper plans available
also look for bundling options sometimes
combining services like internet cable
phone all together in one is cheaper
than having it separately next we have
optimize your Investments if you aren't
investing at least 5% it's worth finding
money from somewhere else whether it's
in your fund bucket that we spoke about
earlier or from negotiating your bills
down that we just spoke about and
reallocating it to your Investments so
action points confirm your contributing
to your pension scheme whether it's a
401k if you're in the US a workplace
pension or a SI if if you're in the UK
and make sure that money is being
invested secondly make sure you're
utilizing other tax-free accounts again
like the Roth IRA if you're in the US or
Isa if you're in the UK if you're in the
UK the real year end that matters is the
5th of April as that's the end of the
tax year but you don't want to wait
until the state because you want to make
sure you're on track to utilize the
allowance that you get every single year
if you don't use this year's allowance
you lose it so whether it's your
lifetime Isa cash Isa stocks shares Isa
check whether you're on track to Max it
out if that's the right financial
decision that makes the most sense based
on your tax bracket and third for the
tax advantage investment accounts don't
just send your money into these accounts
but actually make sure that that money
is getting invested a lot of people make
the mistake of thinking that they're
investing just because they're putting
money into their investment account but
you want to make sure that that money is
also then being invested from that
account or from that rapper into the
right funds as well this section takes
some research focused hours 3 to 4 hours
to complete next on the checklist is
your credit cards the way I see credit
cards is that there are a vehicle to
spend money that I already have in a way
that gets me benefits and gets me
rewards if you don't have the money for
it in cash or in a bank account then you
shouldn't be buying that thing on a
credit card couple of things you want to
think about here and action points for
you to tick off first understand your
spending so based on what we did in the
first exercise with the three buckets
understand where your spending habits
are different cards offer different
rewards so some are good for groceries
whilst other are good for um travel or
dining out check the reward programs of
your current cards and see if they're
aligned with your spending also if you
have a good track record you can get
some extra benefits your credit cards
can wave their fees you can get access
to special offers so definitely worth
calling up your credit card company to
see what they can offer I was really
good with maximizing my credit card
usage and I earned points to get a
companion voucher with British Airways
and then I didn't use it time and the
points expired make a plan to use your
credit card points review what you have
and use them before they expire combined
time orate to complete the checkpoints
in this category 1 hour next debt
firstly audit your debt payoff plan
depending on whether you're going for
the Avalanche debt repayment plan or the
snowball debt repayment plan check are
you on track is there anything you can
do to pay off your debt sooner secondly
try and negotiate your debt interest
again most people don't know that you
can do this but if you have a good track
record already and a good credit score
you can negotiate your APR step three
check your credit report once a year you
want to check your credit report and
make sure everything is accurate and
there are no mistakes on them as this
can have a knock on impact on how much
you pay for your credit cards for your
loan for your mortgages and it's really
not worth passing up on the hour it
takes to go through your credit report
and check if there's any mistakes and to
fix those straight away and then
protecting you and your wealth look at
your insurance need needs and check you
have the right Insurance in place
whether it's life insurance health
insurance mortgage or rentas insurance
check that you have the right one in
place for your situation and the second
checklist in this category is to think
about creating a will if you have
dependence so that's the checklist you
can work your way through to make sure
this year isn't a complete write off and
you've got a clear plan on where you're
headed towards next year I do this every
December to keep myself on track if you
enjoy it or if you know someone who
benefit from it please share it with
them and again the link for the tracker
that I use and for Revue if you want to
check out can be both found in the
description see you next week"
-QCn2XhBCho,"how many people do you know whose
employers haven't given them a raise at
all or if they have is something
insulting like 3 or 4% Which is less
than the rate of inflation so
essentially despite you having another
year of experience you're getting paid
less than you did the year before and
then when you leave the organization
they try to hire someone else they
realize they need to increase the salary
in order to get anyone else to take the
job a middle class habit is just
accepting this the way it is because
it's comfortable you know you're getting
paid x amount on X day no matter what
but this habit will keep you in a cycle
and finding a new job elsewhere could
actually be the best decision you can
make when it comes to getting out of the
r race a more typical pay increase when
you move between organizations is 10 to
20% far higher than the 3 to 4% you
would have got if you stayed in the
company you may think that moving and
starting from scratch is inconvenient
but if you're getting paid 30% more
which you can then put into your
Investments to give you another source
of income it may well be worth it"
4FBlC4-Ccr8,"we often carry this notion that we
should avoid being a burden we don't
really like asking for help or for a
favor and there's this Unwritten rule
that if you're asking or bending the
rules you're being an inconvenience
Cheryl sber mentions in an interview
that she was giving a talk to Facebook
to about 100 employees and at the end of
the talk she had a Q&A section and as
she was answering the questions she said
she'll take two more after the second
question all the woman in the room put
their hands down but she continued
taking questions and this time it was
only from the men in the room because
everyone who had kept their hands up
were the men we want to drop the
assumption that asking is annoying and
that bending the rules or not doing what
someone said is wrong if we ask for
something and we get it great we're
better off and if not we're no worse off
than we were before"
7lFgGhuQr8I,"whenever I'm at a door that doesn't seem
to be opening up for me I think about
the pyramid perspective mindset and it's
understanding that the Journey's
difficulty is inversely proportional to
the number of people who will reach the
top as you climb higher the pyramid gets
narrower and when difficulties show up
it's easy for the majority of people to
give up effectively the crowd will get
thinner and thinner towards the next
level the harder the journey the higher
up you get the harder the challenges you
face but the fewer people there are to
compete with and so the rewards are
bigger hurdles are part of the Journey
To The Top everyone who is growing is
going to fail at some point but what you
do after failing is what differentiates
the successful people from the rest"
spDietDMqoo,"this year we grew this community from
1,000 of us to 800,000 of us and as we
near the end of the year I wanted to
share a special Montage of some of the
best and the most impactful bits from
the most popular videos whether it's a
quote from a book a life-changing lesson
from an expert in their field or
something that I've learned through a
lot of trial and error the next seven
Clips include the principles and the
ways of thinking that have had the most
profound impact on my life enjoy
this is based on the book The Slight
Edge written by motivational speaker
Jeff osen and according to Jeff success
and failure are both a result of the
slight Edge and that's the idea that
simple little things that we choose to
do or choose not to do on a daily basis
have a compounding effect on who we
ultimately become so I like to use the
penny compounding Parable here and that
is that there are two people who are
given the choice to either get $1
million at the beginning of next month
that's it a flat straight check of $1
million here you go or choose to receive
one penny at the beginning of next month
but that Penny doubles every single day
for the next 30 days the person who
chooses to go with that flat $1 million
Mark got that $1 million great but the
person who chose to go with the penny
that doubled every single day ended up
with $5.3 million if you take this
example and stretch it into a longer
time frame that is essentially how
compounding in our life Works those
small little decisions that you make and
small little things you choose to do or
don't do every day matter because they
have long-term ramifications and they
will eventually show up I now try to
remind myself that whatever is
uncomfortable now will become
comfortable later just keep going and
Trust the process of
compounding if you change the way you
look at things the things you look at
change our perception of how well we're
doing is massively driven by society's
expectations and comparisons massively
without a doubt Society applauds lavish
Lifestyles external rankings monetary
achievements if we rewire our thoughts
to look at our own Success Through The
Eyes of us as an individual as opposed
to Through The Eyes of society we can
see ourselves from a completely
different lens and when you do this it
sets you free from comparison it sets
you free from expectations it gives you
the freedom from not having to play the
game where other people are making the
rules Warren buff has talked about
living by this inner scorecard and when
you do this you avoid status games
entirely he says you should think about
how you'd answer this question would you
rather be the world's great lover but
have everyone think that you're the
world's worst lover or would you rather
be the world's worst lover but have
everyone else think that you're the
world's best in other words would you
rather be at the top of your ladder
socially even if you're not and you're a
complete fraud or would you be at the
bottom of your ladder socially knowing
deep down yourself that you're number
one a lot of us get tied up with this
whole find your passion find your
purpose BS and we put so much equity on
it that we don't get started on anything
until we have a clear view on what our
passion or purpose is but the truth is
that very few people are successful from
finding their passion on their first go
and then making a living from it it's so
hard to do and it takes months and years
of trying other things first and seeing
what sticks focus on learning skills
that are practical focus on skills or
businesses that are practical all these
things that you try may not be the thing
that leads to what you where you want to
be eventually but it will definitely
help you in getting there it will put
you further than just sitting and
waiting for your passion and purpose to
come to you before you get started
there's a quote that says if you live
every day like it's your last someday
you will most certainly be right he said
that this quote had a huge impact on him
to the point where every morning he
would look at himself in the mirror and
ask himself if today were the last day
of my life would I want to do what I'm
about to do today and whenever the
answer to that question was no for too
many days in a row he knew it was time
to change something remembering that
we'll all be dead soon is one of the
most important things we can do to make
big choices in life and to overcome fear
because almost everything Pride fear of
embarrassment failure external
expectations they fall away when death
is at the face of you and it only leaves
what is important if we truly understand
this concept and we understand that our
time is limited it really gives you
Clarity to make meaningful choices that
otherwise fear would have stopped you
from making if you think about it right
now in this moment this is the youngest
you'll ever be in your entire life and
that completely blows my mind when I
started recording this video a couple of
minutes ago I'll never be that young
again when I started taking on this
perspective I knew that when I'm older
when I'm 18 assuming I live to 80 I'd be
super disappointed with myself if I
wasted the rest of my days trying to
live someone else's path purely because
I was scared or fearful of something for
me this is the most powerful perspective
to take when it comes to big decisions
that I'm often scared to
take when it comes to major life
decisions everyone will offer their
opinions usually with the best of
intentions and based on their own
experience but if you can find time for
Solitude and introspection and you can
stop letting other people's opinions
dictate your choices that's when things
really start falling into
place this is one that requires the most
war power and discipline but if you
apply it it will pay off we are
constantly surrounded by images of our
friends going out all the time going on
their next big holiday buying a new car
living their best life and constant
pressure of these messages will make you
feel that if you're not doing it you're
missing out but if you constantly let
yourself cave into these temporary
moments you may be sacrificing on what
you can potentially make from the rest
of your life you'll be sacrificing time
that you can spend instead on working on
yourself or working on your side hustle
there is a quote in the book Think and
Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill which states
that the starting point of all
achievements is desire weak desires
bring weak results just as a small fire
makes a small amount of heat through
this He suggests that the intensity of
our desires directly correlates with the
results we get weak desires weak results
whereas strong burning desires can pave
way for stronger and bigger things in
life it's fine to cave in to living your
best life every now and then but what I
find difficult to hear sometimes is when
the no hustle culture is heavily
promoted by people who are at the top of
their game now that they've made it big
they can afford a team and delegate
their work and they can achieve that
so-called balance but they once had that
WR burning desire and made sacrifices
during the climb that they don't talk
about as much I've learned that the best
way to not let fomo get the best of you
is to find a meaning in what you're
doing and know that it's a part of a
bigger picture that you're creating for
yourself and now every time I feel like
fomo is taking over and getting the best
on me I remind myself why I'm doing what
I'm doing and that the strong desire and
all the small sacrifices that I make now
will all be worth
it action before over analysis this is
one that's probably had the biggest
impact on me if there's one thing that
was keeping me in the same place year
after year after year it was a tendency
to overanalyze versus just doing the
thing before starting this YouTube
channel I must have thought about doing
it for a good 6 months while I was
thinking about what my niee should be
what would people care about hearing
from me what should my thumbnails look
like it's great to think about that new
project and think about investing for
the future but what's really going to
make the difference 10 years from now is
whether or not you actually did the
thing even if it feels scary at some
point you become acutely aware that the
result of not taking action will be far
more painful than whatever may happen if
you take action even if you don't have
it all planned out by virtue of just
getting started you're naturally going
to be taking on feedback along the way
just get going you can always change the
path if you need to based on the
feedback you're getting you'll learn and
improve just by doing Jeff osen in the
book The Slight Edge says that the more
you overthink preparing to start your
goal the more overwhelmed you will feel
and the less likely you are to take the
action so keeping your thoughts about
your plan simple helps you get out of
your own head and into action more
quickly just take the opportunity and
you'll learn the most just by doing
it as long as you're doing what you want
to do and you're not hurting anyone else
in doing it then don't spend a second
focusing on what other people on the
sidelines are saying it has been totally
worth it in my opinion I was looking for
something I can do to have more of an
impact on individuals whilst also being
paid for it and this has been just a
thing that has married those two things
up and has allowed me to do that and and
it's a very satisfying feeling when I
get a message from someone saying that
they like my content and that's inspired
them to do something that one message
alone outweighs everything and that's
probably the thing that has kept me
going and kept me going for a year
without seeing any results so if you've
been on the edge of starting something
just go for it you won't look back I
wanted to take a moment to say thank you
so much for joining me on this journey
when I started out I never in a million
years expected it to be what it is now
and there are enough words to express
how humbled I am every single day that
the content I put out resonates with so
many of you and for the support that I
get sometimes it just confuses me but I
never take your support for granted so
all I can say is thank you if we ever
cross path in person please stop me and
say hi I have a resting face also
I'm told but don't let that stop you
there's nothing I love more than
actually meeting you in person and
having a conversation thank you so much
once again and see you next week"
koX4Z9Z0IEg,"there are two games you can play to
measure your financial success and one
of the main reasons people tend to feel
behind financially is because they are
playing the wrong one they are playing
the status game where we're all trying
to one up each other the status game is
an external ranking to everyone else the
size of your home the brand of your
shoes and everything else that you can
see and compare yourself to on social
media the issue is that when you start
playing this game and comparing
internally with everyone else's
projections you're constantly going to
feel on Edge because someone else has to
lose for someone else to be able to win
the second game you can play which is
the wealth game this isn't about what
everyone else can see but instead it's
about what's going on behind the scenes
it's the money in the bank that is being
invested into assets is the business
that you're trying to build on the side
it's the money that you're spending on
self-development it's all the things
that have a positive Roi and that can
ultimately buy you freedom and buy you
the power to live life on your own terms"
cryBA-cm9T0,"there is a concept called loss aversion
which is that the pain of losing is
psychologically twice as powerful as the
pleasure of gaining for instance if we
found $100 on the ground we would be
thrilled it would make our day but if we
lost that same $100 our pain would be
far bigger than the initial joy that we
found in the same thing the same concept
can be applied to our earnings if you
found out you earn more money than your
friends or your colleagues you might
feel slightly more content with your
earnings but that feeling would fade
pretty quickly but on the other hand if
you found out you're earning less money
than them that would have a way bigger
impact on your happiness levels and
you'd feel a lot less satisfied with how
much you're making"
C6Bj591Ub7E,"Mark Zuckerberg despite his immense
wealth took out a $6 million mortgage to
buy his home in California Beyonce and
Jay-Z They financed their $88 million
house with a $52 million mortgage Elon
Musk took out a $50 million loan against
his five properties in California so if
debt is so bad why are these
multi-millionaires who have the money to
pay for things outright taking on more
and more of it for many of us dead is
seen as a burden but for the rich the
same concept is referred to as leverage
and this distinction is not just
semantic it represents two enti highly
different ways of thinking about and
using borrowed money for the majority of
people debt comes in the form of
Consumer loans used for purchases that
don't make any money like a new TV or a
holiday whereas on the other side the
rich often use leverage to make more
money and a mortgage is amongst some of
the cheapest debt you can get and so
these multi-millionaires use borrowed
money to buy their homes which means
they can use their money on other assets
that have higher returns essentially
turning debt into an asset"

understood in my 20s number one the
assigned value framework a number of
studies and research has shown that
money doesn't buy happiness if you're
struggling to make ends me then yes
every additional amount you make can in
fact have a big difference but beyond a
certain level where you've got your
Basics taken care of it may well in fact
be that not making more money or not
taking on that extra money will have a
bigger impact on your happiness than
making that money so consider a scenario
where you're really happy in your day
job the work is fulfilling it pays well
enough it gives you flexibility to enjoy
your relations and your hobbies outside
of work now all of a sudden you're
offered a promotion that promotion comes
with a pay rise but it also comes with
working longer hours and taking on less
enjoyable tasks and less fulfilling work
so you have less time overall to even
spend outside of work with the relations
spending on the things that are of
interest to you a year from now would
you be happier with the promotion and
the more money that came with it Des
despite the drawbacks or in preserving
what you have now and instead leaving
the money on the table this is obviously
more generalized and there's different
things to consider depending on where
you are in your career time Horizon but
my point is that it's very tempting to
maximize every opportunity and not leave
money on the table or feel guilty about
it when maybe the value of not doing it
might be worth more so I try to approach
decisions that I make with my own
assigned value framework so the first
layer is will the extra money I make
from saying yes to doing this thing
impact my happiness levels in a positive
or A negative way if no it doesn't make
a difference then go for it take on the
opportunity and you'll probably be happy
you did it years from now when that
extra money buys you Freedom or
happiness or something else that you
need if the answer is yes it will make a
difference and it make a difference in a
positive way and I'll be happier through
doing it then yeah take on that
opportunity if however the answer is yes
I will make a difference but the pursuit
of doing this thing and the extra money
will be at the cost of my emotion and
mental well-being and my happiness
levels are there for a tradeoff then
comes through another layer which is
what's worth more to you the money or
the assigned mental and emotional cost
of doing the thing that's in relation to
earning that amount no one can assign a
value on your emotional or mental
well-being better than you can so it's
not something that you need to justify
to anyone else and I now use this
framework to make sure that I'm not just
chasing something just because by doing
this you don't feel the need or feel
guilty about leaving money on the table
or feeling the need to squeeze the most
out of every opportunity which comes
with a lot of other costs that we don't
necessarily look at something that has
been worth the value is clean my Mac
which I've been using for nearly 3 years
now I've tried a lot of Mac cleaning
apps and this has been by far the best
and they are doing a 30% off Black
Friday sale right now in less than 2
minutes it scans and cleans up your Mac
in a few clicks it removes any malware
and every time I use that I see a
noticeable difference in the speed and
the functionality of my Mac it feels
like it's new my favorite feature is the
dashboard which which gives me a quick
overview on every aspects of my Max
performance from the battery temperature
to the internet connection and they've
also added a moon lock engine as they
call it where the malware detection
technology can analyze your external
drives and your browser extensions me
and my sister both use it I've got the
option that includes toax and I've left
the link to check it out in the
description you can try out completely
for free let it scan your laptop see
just how much of a difference it makes
and if you decide to continue with the
paid version then by using the code
Nisha n c ha you can get 30% off right
now through the Black Friday sale number
two test and then create one of the most
important business and money laws I've
learned is that there's a delicate
balance between effective planning and
Analysis paralysis and I've sometimes
overstepped into the excessive analysis
part and other times I've fallen short
of the proper planning part so my sister
and I we created an App a few years ago
and it was a networking app centered
around um those that worked in the city
so we spent so much time perfecting it
and we spent a lot of money making it
the best that it could be we thought
that the more perfect it could be and
the more close it could be to the final
product the better our chance of success
and getting buying from other
organizations and people then when we
fully launched it we realized that we
were off the mark there were a lot of
issues that we didn't foresee there
wasn't enough demand and we were
competing in a market where there was so
much competition and looking back I
would have done it very differently Drew
Houston who is the CEO of Dropbox when
he had the idea of Dropbox he spent only
a few months developing a very basic but
functional version of Dropbox it was a
minimal viable product he just wanted to
see firsthand what the reaction of
others would be so he created a 4-minute
video a demonstration showing how it
works and then he sent it to potential
customers asking them to put in their
details and sign up to the waiting list
if they were interested in it that's
very different to someone just saying
yes I'm interested saying yes is easy to
do but signing up and putting your
details in you asking people to put
their money where their mouth is and his
waiting list exploded to 75,000 people
overnight while planning and Perfection
has its place the most crucial thing you
can do for a new product or new business
is to get it into the user's hands as
soon as possible and in this case there
was tangible proof I learned that it
doesn't need to start as a masterpiece
it just needs to be put into the hands
of users to test the hypothesis and then
adapt based on real unfiltered user
feedback the true validation isn't from
theoretical success or from a completed
product in this case but from actual
user engagement number three do the hard
and risky things in life you can see
this is a random mix of my favorite
Three Laws this is one that I'm putting
in because I failed to learn it early
but then I went onto the opposite end of
the spectrum and really understood it by
my late 20s and I'm so thankful I did
because if I didn't push through the
hardships and take a level of risk this
would have been one of my biggest fails
of my life I'm talking about taking
great risks in my 20s 20s and even 30s
are the time to do it when I don't have
responsibilities no one's relying on me
I can work stupid hours which I did in
my day job and then go home and keep
working on my businesses and trying to
push and make it work I'm so grateful
that we set up that app and it failed
and we lost some time and some money but
I learned so many mistakes from it I'm
so glad that I've set up other
businesses and they failed but because I
realized that I'm not good at it I can't
excel at it or I wasn't interested but
I'm so thankful that I started this
YouTube channel and lost my dignity and
embarrassed myself in the early stages I
can't even watch my first few videos
back but I've kept them up because it
shows the time when I was pushing
through awkwardly in my living room and
it gave me the skills to keep getting
better I know that I don't want to be
hustling like I am right now for the
rest of my life I want to do the hard
and the risky things now and then plan
to be chilling someday that's not to say
I'm not enjoying the journey going back
to that framework that we spoke about
earlier it's well worth it but it is to
say that thinking of putting in the hard
work now makes life so much easier so
those are at the moment my top three
business and money laws that I wish I
knew earlier on I hope you enjoyed that
let me know if any of them are
surprising or new to you or if you
disagree with any I'd love to hear from
you I am going to be taking a few weeks
out I'm going to take some time to
reenergize strategize look at things
with a fresh pair of eyes and come back
with some better stories and better
content if you have anything that you
want to see specifically let me know and
I'll make those videos around that I'll
see you in a few weeks so we can close
out this year together as always thank
you for watching and here are some of my
other videos to binge and watch in the
meantime"

EqLM3YfRo3o,"from spending nearly a decade in the
financial sector I've seen what often
holds people back from improving their
finances and breaking through to the
next level is their inability to
identify and remove their toxic money
beliefs so today I wanted to walk you
through five common beliefs that could
be holding you back and more importantly
how to break out of them on pinning
success to an abstract reason this one
holds so many of us back we do it
thinking that helping us but it's in
fact doing the complete opposite the
traditional route and the most common
route people take to make money is
through a 95 job this is one that we're
most familiar with is what we've been
taught to know through the educational
system and so we tend to think that
anyone who has had a reasonable amount
of success or amount of money outside of
the system has done so because of an
abstract reason that's Out Of Reach for
quote the normal person what I mean by
that is and what I've done myself is
I've seen someone reach a level of
success that I could only imagine and
then I've just pinned that success to
just one thing that I don't have maybe
it's oh they had the connections they
knew the right people to be able to do
that or maybe it's oh he's a guy in the
industry so obviously he's going to be
able to do that we tend to
subconsciously thinking this way because
it makes their success a lot easier to
digest but by doing this I realized that
I'm just removing myself from
potentially getting any of the same I'm
just justifying my complacency and
whilst that's the easy route to take and
it may make me feel better for all of 5
minutes in the long run that thinking is
just going to hold me back and I
realized that if you could see someone
else's success with an open minded view
understand how they've got there why
they've got there what things that
they've done outside of what might just
be easy to assume you can start learning
and taking bits away as inspiration and
applying it to your own Journey as well
number two assuming negative intent we
often carry this notion that we should
avoid being a burden we don't really
like asking for help or for a favor and
there's this Unwritten rule that if
you're asking or bending the rules
you're being an inconvenience and this
is specifically more common for women
Cheryl Samberg mentions in an interview
that she was was giving a talk to
Facebook to about 100 employees and at
the end of the talk she had a Q&A
section and as she was answering the
questions she said she'll take two more
after the second question all the woman
in the room put their hands down but she
continued taking questions and this time
it was only from the men in the room
because everyone who had kept their
hands up were the men and I know I'm
guilty for doing the same but I realized
that by not reaching out for
opportunities or wanting to put my neck
on the line even the slightest bit I'm
standing in my own way we want to drop
the assumption that asking is annoying
and that bending the rules or not doing
what someone said is wrong instead we
want to believe that people genuinely do
want to help within their means and
sometimes it just takes us to go that
extra mile if we ask for something and
we get it great we're better off and if
not we're no worse off than we were
before either way we move forward no
hard feelings before I get into the next
point you may have noticed I'm bringing
back some of my handwritten star editing
and that's because I got this screen
protector from paper like that's
completely changed the game when it
comes to my iPad it makes the glass feel
less like glass and much more like
actual paper this version is a paper
like 2.1 and it has special coding of
dots across the sheet which improves the
visual Clarity and that's what gives it
this real paperlike finish paperlike
sent me their Pro bundle which includes
two grips for your apple pencil this
all-in-one cleaning kit that removes any
dirt that has accumulated from using
your iPad screen all day I also use it
for my laptop screen as well this whole
package has made me start using my iPad
again and I forgot how much I like
having all my notes and everything save
digitally so I can connect it across all
my devices if you want to check it out
I'll leave a link in the description
thank you so much to paper like for
sponsoring this video number three
having an entrepreneurial mindset from
my experience when you work in a company
for a very long time you tend to have
this boxed way of thinking it's easy to
follow instructions and you become
comfortable with what you're doing that
you don't want to take on any risks or
any new opportunities outside of that
path because you know that path you know
it's the easy path so you're going to
stick to it but the issue is that when
you start living and breathing through
this fixed mindset you hold yourself
back from getting to the next stage
maybe you think you want to do something
new write a book start a podcast start a
Channel or a website and the next thing
you say is oh actually I don't know how
to go about it and then that's where it
stops you don't move forward from there
the thought process is very two
dimensional and you end up stopping
before you even get to the next stage
whereas those who tend to be a bit more
entrepreneurial it doesn't mean that
they're entrepreneurs it just means that
they have a more business focused
mindset they realize that there is a way
to get everything done their thought
process okay I want to do this what's
the first thing I need to do to learn to
get started and then what do I do from
there it doesn't matter if they don't
know how to do something they understand
that everything can be learned and
there's an answer for every problem if
you feel like you've been at the same
level for a long time and want to break
through to the next the very first
starting point is having a growth
mindset this will be the thing that
leads you to try and take up new
opportunities number four not having
your values in check I've never met
anyone who has become wealthy or broken
free from a repeating cycle or broken
out of a paycheck to paycheck cycle
without setting a clear goal or without
placing a very high value on money I
honestly believe that money tends to
come to those who make it a priority
it's not a matter of chance you can't
accidentally become successful or
wealthy it does require focused effort
when I made the decision to take my life
under control and start getting my side
hustles to a pace where it matches my
fixed cost I knew that it would require
a lot of sacrifices even though I didn't
know anyone who had done what I wanted
to do and the path that I wanted to take
so I wasn't really able to absorb or
constantly be around the information to
get there everything that I did consume
put me on to the right level of
frequency so I surrounded myself with
YouTube channels books podcasts
Instagram pages that aligned with my
goal and then make sure that my value of
being financially independent stayed at
the top sometimes what people say their
values are don't align with their
actions you might think oh I want to
level up financially but nothing you're
consuming or doing is matching what you
said say and I recently came across a
value quiz by Dr Martini that asks you
deep questions about your priorities
your thoughts your actions and then lets
you know based on how you've answered
them where money falls into that value
I'll link it below and if you believe
something is important to you but your
surroundings and the things you're
consuming don't align with it then it
might be time some things change around
number five not needing to acquire
financial literacy I know so many people
who have let someone else take control
over all aspects of their financial life
life they don't know how much tax
they're paying they don't know what's
coming in and out of their account they
don't know if they're spending more or
less than they earn because they've
never tra it money is a huge part of our
Lives whether we like to admit it or not
much of our Lives is dictated around
money the reason why we work so hard is
to pursue a life of financial
Independence that comes through learning
about money so not spending time to
reach a certain level of understanding
of such an important life skill you're
essentially just holding yourself back
you have to have a level of financial
literacy to level up and actually build
wealth and break out of a cycle there
are so many books YouTube channels
podcasts if you don't know where to
start I'll leave a video right here by
Yours Truly where I talk about how to
manage your money on payday how much of
your income you should be allocating to
what category how much you should be
saving and investing so I'll leave you
with that thank you for watching and
I'll see you
there"
mXEhbsDB1ag,"I'm about to resign I'm also letting go
of a sixf figure
bonus a sixf figure sign on that's Beau
be paid to me in March I've just sent my
manager I'm shaking I've just sent my
manager a message to have a chat this
morning
so let's see how it
goes I spent the last nine years
climbing the corporate ladder getting
promoted taking on more responsibilities
asking for pay Rises negotiating bigger
bonuses and then earlier this year I
decided to walk away I decided to leave
investment banking for good and to date
it was the hardest decision I've ever
had to make and making it just two
months before receiving what would have
been the largest bonus of my career
probably makes it seem like I had lost
my mind to anyone on the outside the
truth is that even I didn't know if I
was making the right decision or if
everything think would turn out okay but
what I didn't know is that if I didn't
take the chance I would live to regret
it as Obama famously said you don't have
to be 100% certain to make a decision
gather all the ideas the information
gather all the perspectives to get you
21% and once you reach that point make
the decision and find peace in the fact
that your choice was based on the
information that you had at that time
hopefully by sharing with you what got
me to the 51% it will give you the
courage to make
do the
same throughout the 9 years I spent in
banking there were a handful of people
who I really enjoyed working with and
one of those people was a woman who
worked in the same team as me she had
been doing the job for nearly 20 years
she loved what she did and she kind of
took on this mental role with me
she told me how things were done she sat
back with me after work to answer my
questions she gave me the lowdown on all
the office politics and then about 7
months after I joined the bank one
evening in the office her phone rank she
picked up put the phone down and walked
away from her desk and as soon as she
left my manager called me into another
room he told me I had just been promoted
and then explained the details of my new
position I told him that it sounded very
similar to her role and that we're now
covering the exact same clients so
what's the difference and he clarified
that she was with HR and had just been
let go at a time where I should have
been celebrating I just got promoted I
found myself in a situation that was
completely the polar opposite and it
changed my whole perspective on
professional life I learned that the
company you work for ultimately doesn't
owe you anything but a paycheck and in
this particular instance yes great I was
on the fortunate side but next year the
tables could turn and who's to say I
won't be on the other side they say
You're only as good as the hours you can
dedicate when you're working for someone
else and the amount that you earn is
directly tied to your time but the issue
is that even your time isn't in your
control and I realize that I can never
truly be financially independent and
financially free so long as I'm letting
someone else have more control over my
financial life than I
do the first few years of working in a
corporate they were fun they were
intellectually stimulating I was
learning a lot I felt like I was in this
real growth phase and then after that
things seemed to Plateau it wasn't
exciting anymore I wasn't feeling
challenged and I felt misaligned and
that feeling of misalignment it kept
getting bigger and really started to
take a toll on my mental health so I
decided to sign up for therapy sessions
and in my second session my therapist
told me that I need a life coach and I
remember thinking what on Earth how do I
even go about this what's the life coach
going to do let me just try and figure
this out my my own and so I went home
and I spent the next few days alone I
didn't do anything else but really
understand why I was feeling a certain
way why I was feeling misaligned what I
wanted to get out of life and why I was
feeling at the time really caged up and
during those days I realized I had
absolutely no interest in helping CEOs
of large companies or working on billion
doll transactions and the only reason
why I was doing it was firstly the
paycheck and second L the social status
I hate to admit it but I'd be lying if I
said that didn't play a massive part I
was living life solely based on
society's expectations I believed that I
should be grateful for having a somewhat
prestigious job and earning a good
salary because that's what most people
desire but it's not what I desired my
why is to inspire and motivate people to
take control of their finances and
ultimately their lives through sharing
my knowledge of money and my perspective
of money that's what success meant and
means for me that's what I do through my
YouTube channel through my courses
through my free workshops and what I can
tell you now is when you get clear on
what you want and what you want to do
and you live and breathe there and you
become so obsessed with doing that thing
nothing else matters whilst that six
figure bonus which I'll talk about more
in a second was incredibly incredibly
hard to walk away from I had got to a
point where no amount of additional
money would be able to keep me away from
living my why from the outside every
single person I spoke to told me I
should reconsider what I'm about to do
and every single person told me to stay
for a little bit longer so that I can at
least get paid that bonus but at this
point my bigger meaning took over yes I
could go back and cave in and get that
bonus but that would be an excuse for me
to stay for another year and another
year and keep getting paid to live
someone else's Vision rather than
working on my own when it comes to major
life decisions everyone will offer their
opinions usually with the best of
intentions and based on their own
experience but if you can find time for
Solitude and introspection and you can
stop letting other people's opinions
dictate your choices that's when things
really start falling into place maybe
your meaning and your purpose is within
your day job and you don't believe the
common notion that everyone should quit
or you might feel the exact opposite
regardless just make sure that that
decision is yours and not driven by
Society
for a lots of people on social media
following your why is enough to quit
your job but if you've watched my other
videos You full well know I've never
endorsed that idea on this platform I've
expressed frustration towards anything
or anyone promoting the notion of
leaving your job to just follow your why
implying that hard work alone will fix
everything and sort everything else out
it takes a specific type of person to
take that level of risk and that person
isn't me and that's precisely why the
the two major factors I mentioned
earlier weren't enough to tip the scale
because let's be honest bills exist
mortgage or rent payments exist
responsibilities exist that's just a
part of life and that is why I wasn't
able to leave sooner than I did I stayed
in banking for longer than I wanted to
because my salary was paying for me to
build up an emergency fund it was paying
for all of my investments my stocks and
shares property it was paying for all
the experiments I was doing behind the
scenes on my side hustles and yes I took
a huge pay cut at the time that I
resigned it was an 84% pay cut but I was
also in a very fortunate position that I
had enough of an emergency fund to last
me 9 months in case something didn't
work out and it was only when my side
hustles had matched my fixed costs plus
an additional 200 or300 more a month was
I comfortable in taking that risk I'm 30
we don't have kids and I knew that a
I'll be a lot happier doing something
that I truly love whilst giving back in
some way and B I'll still be able to
make money from it in a way that's not
tied to me trading my time like having
an impact on other people and getting
paid whilst I'm doing it there's nothing
better than that the reason why this
video makes me smile is because it was a
happi as I had been in a very long time
I finally felt aligned and like I was
getting paid to do something that I
loved what I didn't know as I was
recording that was that I'll be in a
position where I am now which is what I
make is astronomically higher than what
I used to make in banking I just did
what I loved I pushed myself out of my
comfort zone I became so obsessed with
my bigger meaning that I didn't have
time to think about what anyone else
thought I took the risk and I hoped that
the remaining 49% would somehow unfold
at the end of the day this is my journey
this is the path that I've decided to
take and the things that I did to get
there it may not be the right path for
everyone but hopefully by sharing some
of this it will give you the inspiration
and the courage to do the thing that
you've been putting up for so
long"
4sT2B2SRypo,"over the last 5 years I have tried and tested so 
many different strategies to manage my money and  
I've done that because understanding how to 
manage your money and be in control of your  
money is one of the most important life skills 
we can learn today it doesn't matter if you're  
making 50,000 or a 100,000 a year the number one 
thing that makes a difference is how you're able  
to manage that money and the real skill of money 
management is about making the most of the money  
that you have not just for investing and for 
growing wealth but instead to find the perfect  
balance between living in the moment and planning 
for the future when you find something that a  
is easy to do and B it's easy to maintain then 
managing your money stops feeling like a chore  
so in this video I wanted to talk you through my 
three-step method for effectively managing your  
money in a way that makes you feel in complete 
control of what is coming in and out of your  
account every month I'll also give you some of 
my favorite tips along the way if you want to  
use the same template that I have created then 
in the description box you can find completely  
for free the link to to download and use this 
to incorporate for your own finances as well  
okay so this is what the tracker looks like it's 
got the colorcoded spending categories the income  
section at the top and then the overview on this 
table over here so these sales will change color  
as you start filling in the sheet you'll see in 
just a moment you just have to click file make  
a copy and then you can duplicate it and use it 
for yourself now step one is to define the three  
fword wait for it a key part of being in control 
of your money is defining where you want to but  
before we even do that you need to First figure 
out exactly how much money you're bringing home  
each month so this is the amount that lands in 
your bank account after tax if you have multiple  
income sources you want to include all of them 
in here your 9 to-5 day job your weekend gig your  
freelancing work that you do on the side maybe 
some Investments that are paying off whatever  
these numbers are you want to put them in the 
top left blue section over here for example if  
I'm making 3,000 a month after taxes for my day 
job I'll put that here another 200 a month let's  
say from my creative side hustle and 500 a month 
from freelancing so you just plug in those numbers  
at the top now if you're employed the number 
is pretty straightforward it's the amount that  
lands into your bank account each month after 
tax and other state contributions have already  
been deducted so in this case that's a 3,000 a 
month but if you already contribute towards your  
workplace pension you actually want to add that 
number back in So if you contribute say 200 a  
month towards your pension add that 200 back into 
this and so that number would instead be 3,200  
the reason for this is because the amount that 
you're putting towards your pension contribution  
actually goes towards the future U category 
which will come to in a second now if you're  
self-employed or you're a freelancer you need 
to take into account taxes the last thing you  
want to do is assume you have all this money 
coming in and Define your goals on a higher  
number than you should and then be disappointed 
when you don't hit your goals so in this case  
the 200 from my side hustle and the 500 from my 
freelancing work that is after tax once you put  
those numbers in your total income is calculated 
now that we've done that we can Define the three  
FS the fundamental bucket the fund bucket and the 
future you bucket you want to decide how much of  
your net income so the 3,700 in this case you 
want to put towards each of these buckets the  
funds allocated to the fundamental bucket are 
dedicated to your essential needs these are the  
non-negotiables of Life housing Transportation 
food money placed in the fund bucket those are  
the costs that enrich your life with joy with 
experiences and then lastly everything you put  
into the future you bucket that is an investment 
towards the life you envision years down the road  
in the world of budgeting there is a popular 
guideline that you may have heard of called  
the 50320 rule it suggests that 50% of your 
net income should go towards the fundamental  
needs 30% should go towards the fund bucket and 
20% should go towards the future U so those are  
the percentages that I'm going to put into this 
column right here so 50% towards fundamentals  
30% towards fun and and 20% towards future me 
and what you'll see as we start filling in the  
sheet and putting your numbers and your actual 
spending in is that the colors of these sales  
will change depending on whether or not you're 
in line with your goals or if you're overspending  
or under saving I do want to make a quick Point 
here actually about the 50 3020 guideline it was  
introduced in 2005 in the book all your worth the 
ultimate lifetime money plan and so it was during  
a different economic landscape over the years 
we have seen inflation Rising healthcare costs  
inreased student loan debt fluctuating housing 
markets all of these factors have really impacted  
people's disposable income and the proportion of 
their income that goes towards their fundamental  
needs so you may want to modify these percentages 
and tweak them based on your unique circumstances  
you want to start filling in the three colorcoded 
columns in the middle so the fundamentals the fun  
stuff and the future you the fundamentals like 
we said are the non-negotiables they are the  
fundamental things for your day-to-day living 
so this includes things like housing your rent  
or your mortgage payments includes utilities 
and other bills so we're talking about um water  
gas electricity it includes Transportation 
so your car payment train tickets to get to  
work or any other mode of Transport that you pay 
for groceries would also go into here Insurance  
minimum debt payments for your debt o ations and 
you want to find what you spend on each of these  
by looking through your bank statements so your 
debit card statement your credit card statement  
or any apps that you use it may be that your app 
automatically categorizes your spending for you  
so maybe all your utilities come into one so 
you can put that one number as a total let's  
say 200 into this cell over here or you can split 
it up so break it down by water gas electricity it  
depends on how detailed you want this to be when 
it comes towards spending towards your needs you  
want to as much as possible have this automated 
have direct debit set up so that everything is  
getting paid automatically the more friction you 
can take out of anything the more likely you're  
able to keep that thing up the last thing you 
want is to receive constant monthly reminders  
to pay your bills and then you need to remember 
your password log into your system enter your bank  
details manually transfer each month it's just not 
fun and these kind of things make managing your  
money a chore it creates unnecessary friction so 
once you go through and enter all these numbers so  
let's say 1,200 for mortgage 100 for utility 30 
for phone and you keep filling in these numbers  
you can then check the table on the right and 
that will immediately show how you are doing in  
relation to your goals so I had to set a Target 
here of 50% of my net income to spend towards the  
fundamentals but this sale here has turned red so 
I'm clearly exceeding that threshold so then you  
need to reassess that goal and that something will 
come to in step three and this column by the way  
at the end it shows the actual amount that you're 
spending in the currency that you're spending in  
this way you have a clear idea of both the portion 
of your income that you're spending in terms of  
percentages towards each of these categories 
but also the exact amount you're spending as  
well then we have the middle column and that is 
the fun stuff now you want to be really clear  
with yourself here you want to clarify these 
categories from the outset you really don't  
want your fun stuff creeping into your needs just 
to justify some spending so the fun bucket is all  
the things that are not essential these are the 
things that at the core are completely optional  
so examples of what can fall into the fun category 
include subscriptions like Netflix Spotify Amazon  
Prime entertainment so things like going out 
to the movies eating out getting that round  
of drinks self-care so things like your nails 
facial haircuts and traveling these are all  
examples of what falls into the fun category 
the fun bucket also includes those upgrade  
decisions that you make so if you're buying a 
Mercedes instead of buying a more economical  
Toyota or if you're shopping at Marks and Spencers 
instead of Tesla goes or getting a gym membership  
instead of working out at home those are all 
upgrades they're little extras that you spend  
money on that makes life more enjoyable and more 
entertaining so you can see a few more examples  
that I've put in there and again you could split 
it out so I've got clothing as spending 200 100  
in that category you could split that out and 
make it as detailed as you want you could have  
a line by line jumper trousers or whatever you've 
bought in the clothing section everything could  
go into here once you fill in all the categories 
for your wants as I've done here the table on the  
right again will signal whether you're on track 
or whether you need to cut back once again in  
this case I'm spending 25% of my net income on 
my wats so the sale hasn't flagged up I've got  
some leeway I've got some room to spend more if 
I want and then the third column is the future  
UB bucket and this is all about paying yourself 
first there are a few ways you can do this but I  
always recommend setting up automatic transfers 
from your bank account that you get paid into  
into a separate savings account as soon as you get 
paid again when you create a system that works for  
you you remove the need for willpower you remove 
any friction and there's no excuse not to save you  
don't get to the end of the month and realize 
you don't have enough money to be able to save  
like you said you would at the start of the month 
all of that push and pull just disappears in this  
category you can include things like investing 
in stocks and shares topping up your emergency  
fund and putting money towards your savings funds 
if you're not sure where you should start and in  
which order you should put money towards I have 
a video right here that explains step by step  
where you should be putting your money and in 
what order when it comes to your savings fund  
I would also recommend having a separate account 
for each of your bigger saving goals so if you're  
saving for a house have a house fund if you're 
saving for a car have a car fund have them all  
with specific purposes that way you're keeping 
them separate and you could easily just log into  
your account and check what the balance is and 
how far off or close you are to that goal it's  
a lot more motivating than having it all in one 
as just a savings pop so there a sale right here  
for the future U category that works in reverse 
if you're contributing less than the amount you  
initially planned for the future you the savings 
and investment bucket then the sale will turn red  
indicating that you're not saving enough and then 
we're on to step three and that is the reflections  
arguably the most important part there's no point 
in coming up with all these goals and all these  
of questions you can consider and ask yourself is 
have you paid all your bills on time are there any  
late payments if so why can you set that up to be 
automatic are any of the sales read meaning either  
you spent more than you should or you saved less 
than you should if that's the case why did that  
happen what did you spend on if it's that you're 
spending too much in the fun bucket then are  
there ways to get the same thing for less or is it 
that you simply need to reassess and cut some of  
those things out or maybe you spent less than you 
thought you would in your fun bucket in which case  
you can increase maybe your savings an investment 
section you could pay more towards yourself and  
pay off your debt faster it might be that this is 
the first month that you're tracking your spending  
in which case these percentages might need 
some tweaking to make it something that is more  
sustainable over the long run instead of just like 
plugging the numbers and closing it and getting on  
with your life reflect at the end of the month and 
see where you can improve your finances once again

tceuS_E9ia4,"everyone says you should invest in yourself but 
where do you start what are some of the highest  
leverage skills you can learn to make the most 
amount of money in the least amount of time in  
have number one having a personal brand a personal 
brand is something that will subconsciously be in  
people's mind when they think and talk about you 
it is what someone thinks of when they think of  
you the words they would use to describe you what 
your selling points are what your values are how  
you present yourself to the world for instance if 
You' look at Steve Jobs when you think of him you  
think of his jeans and turtleneck uniform all very 
simple easy and his brand was an extension of him  
it was very simple yet effective and everything 
he touched and created had a ridiculous level  
of attention to detail then you have Indra nuui 
who is one of the previous CEOs of PepsiCo she  
had a personal brand centered around power and 
purpose she prioritized sustainability and she  
led PepsiCo to expand its product range and move 
towards healthier options whilst she was CEO the  
reason why a personal brand and creating one is so 
important is because that thing without you even  
knowing will have an impact on what your next job 
is when your next promotion will be growing your  
business the customers you get when you understand 
the power of this you can identify values or  
qualities you want to be known for and then create 
a personal brand based on those values people  
who share the same values as you will connect 
with you it's about the skills the experiences  
you have your integrity how you communicate with 
others I was thinking about what my personal brand  
is and how I would describe it in three words 
and I would say firstly it's a no BS approach  
with things I like to be straight to the point I 
love facts and there's no beating around the bush  
just what you need to know with no filler words 
secondly transparency I'm very open especially  
cheerleader I like to take a go- getet it approach 
with everything I do and I like to try and push  
that attitude onto as many people as I can and I 
like to think I bring these values to my YouTube  
channel as well and even if it wasn't YouTube 
whatever I do for a living those are the values  
that I'd like to uphold in everything that I do 
so think about what values you want to live by and  
is probably the most important one on the list and 
I would go as far as saying it is more important  
than all the skills and the qualifications and the 
knowledge that you have whatever you're thinking  
of launching whether it's a YouTube channel a 
business a project a podcast or anything else it  
all starts somewhere with an idea and you probably 
have an idea right now but without action the idea  
is nothing multiple people will have the same 
idea probably at the same time but most people  
when they have an idea they won't action it that 
idea will be overshadowed by fear by laziness by  
doubt by uncertainty and they simply won't do it 
there are people who are less capable than you  
less skills less experience but they are doing 
something that you want to do and I'm making a  
lot of money from it just because they went for 
it when I started this Channel and I hit my first  
100,000 subscribers I remember so many people 
telling me like how hard it is to get to that  
point and they screenshotted and sent me articles 
about how only 0.1% of people get there how many  
personal finance channels there are etc etc and 
I remember looking at all of this information  
and thinking I am so glad that I didn't know any 
of this information before if I knew this at the  
time of me starting and trying to build a YouTube 
channel I wouldn't have done it I would have t P  
myself out of it 100% definitely I would have 
stayed in my box doing what I know taking zero  
risks sometimes you've got to ignore everything 
else you've got to ignore the numbers ignore the  
data ignore the little signs that are telling 
you not to do something and override all of it  
start and then learn don't learn and then start 
number three the ability to organize the chaos  
whether it's for note taking for admin tasks 
for side projects delegation the contrast in  
perform performance and in self-control between 
someone who can maintain an organized workflow  
and someone who has just a disorganized chaotic 
mess is huge when I first started on my YouTube  
journey I had a separate document for everything 
I was alternating between Microsoft Word and then  
Google Drive and then PowerPoint and then I'll 
be using Gmail to communicate with everyone else  
and it was a huge mess and I don't know how long I 
would have been able to keep that up for alongside  
having a day job you really want to try and and 
create your system or anything you're doing to  
be more organized in a way that is really easy 
for you to keep on top of things so the system  
I use for almost everything that happens behind 
the scenes of my workflow is notion and I reached  
out to them and asked if they could sponsor this 
video and they very kindly agreed so I'll show  
you what my system looks like so I have the main 
workspace homepage which then branches off into  
the different areas of my life my goals my admin 
stuff my content creation and each of these Pages  
or these sub Pages has different access level 
depending on who is involved so for example this  
is my content creative track which basically 
includes all my ideas ATZ when it comes to my  
YouTube and then the videos I'm researching 
and planning they move into that column and  
then the videos that are ready to record once 
I've recorded them I move it into the editing  
column which my editor then has access to and then 
he'll know what is going to release next and what  
he needs to start working on actually shout out 
to Ally who walked me through his workflow and  
gave me the inspiration to have it all set out 
like this and what's cool is I could go into to  
each of these scripts and I can leave comments 
and links within it so for the last video that  
went out I left a links and comments to all the 
research papers I read and then my editor go in  
and see okay at what sentence Did she speak 
about a research paper okay I can then create  
a graphic around that based on what the link is 
I've also got a project task here on the making  
money Workshop that I mentioned that's coming 
up link below to sign up so here's everything  
that I'm planning for the 3 days the ideas that I 
have jotted down and I have the notion app so even  
when I'm on the go when I think of an idea I'll 
just open up the app and then put it in and it's  
all kind of connected across my laptop as well 
I also have the upgraded AI feature which I pay  
for and that's a really good addition my favorite 
feature on that is the ability for the system to  
check your spelling and grammar so when it comes 
to my weekly newsletters that go out I write them  
up in notion and then just as I'm finished I I 
ask notion AI to do a proof read to check all my  
spelling and grammar and then once that's done 
it's ready to go out one of one of the things  
that's helped me consistently upload every week 
without losing my mind and running out of ideas  
is notion and I've now used it for so many other 
areas of my life whether it's note taking or admin  
or having my paperwork what subscriptions I've 
got like everything is in there if you want to  
create some organization in your life I would 
highly recommend giving it a go you can try it

is marketing and sales in the vast expanse of  
skills We Gather throughout our lives marketing 
and skills stand out as two of the most valuable  
and when you first think about it these skills 
seem limited to just the business world but so  
much of our Lives revolves around the simple 
Act of persuading and communicating if you  
think about it every day we find ourselves in a 
situation where we need to promote or we need to  
sell something it could be simple like trying to 
persuade your friend to try a new restaurant or  
negotiating with your child about bedtime or as 
complex as presenting a business proposal the key  
is how effectively can you convince someone of 
your point of view when I first started on The  
Graduate scheme at the first bank that I worked 
at I had this idea that helped graduates on the  
program better understand what all the different 
teams in the department did so that they can use  
that information to make an informed Choice when 
deciding on what their next role will be and what  
their career trajectory will look like and at 
the time I came up with my idea and I pitched  
this idea to my mentor before pitching it to HR 
and I explained it very differently to how I just  
did I completely over complicated it I wrapped 
the idea up in layers of unnecessary detail and  
made it very confusing and my mentor at the 
time so grateful for him he basically told me  
how dull my proposal was and that was too long 
and he couldn't clearly see the benefits of it  
and that was the first time I realized the 
importance of being able to Simply explain  
an idea and make it persuasive I knew it was a 
great idea but I just didn't know the best way  
to present it and he sat with me for hours and 
refined it and listened to me practice multiple  
times and the real thing went down really well 
but the point is you might have something really  
valuable but if you can't unlock it for others 
it's value diminishes and your ability to Market  
to sell to communicate that will set your ideas 
apart so those are four of what I believe are  
the most important skills and character traits to 
have to increase your income I love to hear from  
you if any of these in particular resonate with 
you and what you're doing to improve in that area

NKjdNjhDTbk,"the most important thing you can possibly do for 
your finances and to get to Financial Freedom is  
to save a certain portion of your income 
but that is far easier said than done in  
fact 40% of the UK find themselves trapped in a 
paycheck to paycheck cycle and 62% of Americans  
do not have enough savings to cover 3 months 
of living expenses saving money is hard not  
only because of the cost of basic necessities 
that is increasing but also because our desire  
for instant gratification often takes presidents 
over saving for the long term so after trying to  
understand and figure out ways to save more money 
both through personal experiences and by reading  
numerous research papers on the psychology of 
saving I have put together some of my favorite  
evidence-based strategies that will help you 
save more money effortlessly number one realize  
that things have a happiness cap there's a 
research paper titled if money doesn't make  
you happy then you probably aren't spending it 
right and this paper illustrates how there are  
some key principles you can follow when it comes 
to spending that will have a direct great impact  
on your happiness levels and once you realize that 
spending on things I.E material possessions has a  
happiness cap it will very likely change the way 
you think about spending and therefore mean you're  
able to save more just by virtue of this changed 
perception for instance over my late teens early  
20s I spent a lot of money on tangible items and 
I'd accumulated so much stuff clothing stationer  
accessories gadgets I just had so much things 
and when I moved out I only took about 20% of  
that stuff with me the remaining I either left 
behind in my family home or I sold it and then  
when I moved again about 20% of that 20% of the 
stuff came with me and I sold the rest and now I  
own fewer things than I did 8 years ago but I'm 
much happier and I don't even remember what the  
other stuff was in fact I don't even realize 
what I don't have unless I go to my family  
home and I see something collecting dust in the 
Loft and I think oh that was nice I forgot I had  
that but that's the thing I forgot these material 
possessions are separate from you and they largely  
remain distinct from your identity you you buy 
them you use them and then they become part of  
the background whereas the very first principle 
in the research paper suggests that one of the key  
ways to use money to buy happiness is to buy more 
experiences and fewer material Goods it explains  
that experiences are better than things because 
we adapt to things more quickly so the stuff I  
used to own became unnoticed I didn't feel any 
different without those items but in contrast  
your memory of seeing or going on that once in 
a-lifetime road trip with your friends from school  
that will continue to provide happiness and the 
second reason why experiences tend to be better  
than things when it comes to spending money on 
is that we are more likely to mentally revisit  
our experiences than we are to our things or to 
the day we bought something so our minds have a  
tendency to think back to experiences and when 
we recall an experience or a specific event we  
don't just remember that event we bring back the 
feelings and the connection we felt at the time  
as well and so the study suggest that in part 
our experiences are more centrally connected to  
our identities recognizing this and just being 
mindful of it every time you're on the cusp of  
buying something tangible or buying a material 
item that you don't necessarily need will give  
you more of a reason to stop yourself and think 
about either saving it or using it to spend on  
an experience which will shape who you are the 
second strategy is changing your narrative a lot  
of why we find it difficult to save is because 
of delayed gratification we don't get the same  
kick or the same reward from saving as we do 
from spending but if we can attach meaning to  
savings we can increase the value of the future 
reward in the present and there's a study that  
I found really interesting in the paper titled 
leveraging psychological fit to encourage saving  
Behavior the study analyzes the saving rate 
between two groups of Indian households and  
the first is asked to save as much as they can on 
a weekly basis and then the second group is asked  
to save as much as they can on a weekly basis but 
they're asked to put those Savings in an envelope  
with a photo of their children on the envelope 
is going towards them after 15 weeks those that  
had saved in the envelope with a photo on it had 
saved just under 12% more than the group without  
the meaning attached to the saving and not only 
did those househol save more but they were less  
likely to deplete those savings through spending 
we don't all have the same narratives and the  
paper clearly suggests that not all saving goals 
are created equal while saving for your children  
might be a motivating factor for one family or for 
one person it may not be so motivating for another  
person and so to close that intention action Gap 
we need to better understand what motivates us to  
make that sacrifice now and make our saving goals 
aligned with our motivations and I find that many  
people save without really having an end goal in 
mind but doing this makes the whole idea of saving  
a bit of a chore and not something you want to do 
it makes it feel like you're missing out but when  
you create a meaning around the saving it makes 
you much more likely to save maybe the idea of  
renting a home makes you feel anxious and you 
want a place you can call yours it gives you  
peace of mind sense of relief then saving for a 
deposit for a house purchase might be the thing  
that drives you and all the emotional attachments 
that come with saving for that or maybe a big part  
of you wants to work for yourself and do your own 
thing instead of working for a company then maybe  
having a saving fund that gives you the ability 
to take a level of risk or pursue a side project  
and create a bigger meaning for your life might 
be a lot more enticing than just saving a larger  
emergency fund let's say when the whole point of 
money is to use it as a tool to create a life that  
you want think about what you're saving for and 
create a meaning around it and use that whenever  
you're tempted to buy anything it makes the idea 
of saving a lot easier strategy three turning  
saving into a habit whilst adding an emotional 
attachment to something can make saving easier  
a Sure Fire way to increase your saving is by 
having no emotional attachment to it whatsoever  
and instead making it a system where the willpower 
needed is completely removed from the equation so  
one way to do that like I've said so many times on 
this channel is by setting up a direct debit that  
automatically takes a portion of your paycheck as 
soon as you get paid into a savings account that  
way you go about your monthly spending having 
already adjusted for for the lower amount that  
you have available and you don't even realize 
what you're missing out on because that money  
isn't even there to start with or another option 
is you could go for specific accounts that round  
up your spending to the nearest pound or the 
nearest Dollar every time you spend and then  
it saves and invest difference so for instance 
say you spend $435 it will round up to that next  
dollars it'll Round Up to $5 and the difference 
the 65 will be saved and invested for you in the  
background I mean the catch here is that you need 
to spend more to save more so while this can work  
for some people I'd recommend going for option one 
instead strategy four understand different focal  
points and this is a bit of a working progress 
finding the right balance between enjoying the  
present and planning the future it's an art and 
it's a continual work in progress during my early  
20s I was all about living life to the Max and 
being really spontaneous and the thrill of living  
in the moment and this thinking made me spend 
everything I earned and it came at a cost the  
cost was probably staying in the same place and 
one that I didn't really want to be in for far  
too long then I went through a whole other phase 
and that was almost as a reaction to my earlier  
spending and this time I was saving twice as hard 
everything I made was saved I operated with a  
singular Focus to accumulate enough money to one 
day quit my job and do something that I wanted  
to do a journey that I'll be sharing in a video 
coming up but like the pendulum that swings from  
one extreme to another and whilst both of these 
approaches taught me different things at different  
points in my life neither of them was sustainable 
because they didn't capture the essence of a truly  
Balanced Life and that's fine you may need to go 
through extreme phases of saving to be able to  
get that balance life later on but it's only now 
that I'm learning the art of balance it's learning  
exactly how and where I want to spend and what I 
just don't care about and don't need to spend on  
True Balance I've learned isn't about strictly 
following one philosophy or another it's about  
trying things out knowing yourself and adjusting 
your approach based on what you prioritize in  
a given time on that note I'm super excited to 
say that I'm launching a free 3-day money-making  
Workshop in November and on day two out of those 
three days I'll go into more detail of the stuff  
we've covered in this video psychology based tips 
saving strategies the kind of accounts you need  
to boost your savings how to cultivate a wealth 
oriented mindset we did one of these earlier this  
year and I'll leave some screenshots on the screen

n_iQ68YQgvY,"for a very long time fear dictated my life it 
stopped me from switching jobs it stopped me from  
asking for a pay rise it stopped me from putting 
an offer down on a new property and if I hadn't  
learned how to overcome fair I wouldn't even be 
here recording this video because fear would have  
stopped me from starting a YouTube channel fear 
manifests differently for each of us but one thing  
is common and that is that it can significantly 
impact your ability to achieve what you want to  
do it can be the fear of failure the fear of what 
people might think of you it can be the fear of  
inadequacy but as long as you let fear dictate 
your life it will hold you back so in this video I  
wanted to walk you through how I used fear setting 
to ultimately change my life and make more money  
fear is a natural and a biological condition 
that all of us experience and it has been  
ingrained into us for millions of years when our 
survival was constantly threatened by Predators  
the rest of starvation extreme weather fear 
is what protected us it aided our survival but  
that same evolutionary response can in today's 
world actually hold us back these threats that  
we Once Upon a Time had are no longer an everyday 
occurrence but instead we're generally safe we're  
generally comfortable but our natural response 
still exists over the past year I've met people  
from various walks of life some are loving the 
corporate life aspiring to climb the corporate  
ladder others want to start a side hustle or start 
their own business and throughout these encounters  
I've often heard elements of fear being put 
through in people's thoughts like I want to  
quit my job but I don't have a backup plan I don't 
want to promote myself on social media because I'm  
scared about what others might think of might work 
I don't want to start that business because I'm  
afraid of failing these feelings are completely 
normal and completely understandable but if you  
aim to earn more or live a unique life or deviate 
from the conventional path it is so important to  
confront these fairs successful people are 
not Fearless they experience the same fears  
that we do the difference lies in their ability 
to address and overcome them so the very first  
thing you want to do is put yourself in the line 
of fire of fear so that you can understand what  
is actual fear and what is just a very high level 
of discomfort and over the past year I've started  
to use this concept that Steve Jobs talks about 
in his commencement speech in Stanford which I  
probably watched over a thousand times I'll link 
the full video Below in this speech he talks about  
three pivotal moments of his life and the third 
of those three moments is about death there's a  
quote that says if you live every day like it's 
your last Sunday you will most certainly be right  
he said that this quote had a huge impact on 
him to the point where every morning he would  
look at himself in the mirror and ask himself if 
today were the last day of my life would I want  
to do what I'm about to do today and whatever the 
answer to that question was no for too many days  
in a row he knew it was time to change something 
remembering that will all be dead soon is one of  
the most important things we can do to make big 
choices in life and to overcome fear because  
almost everything Pride fear of embarrassment 
failure external expectations they fall away when  
death is at the face of you and it only leaves 
what is important if we truly understand this  
concept and we understand that our time is limited 
it really gives you Clarity to make meaningful  
choices that otherwise fear would have stopped 
you from making if you think about it right now  
in this moment this is the youngest you'll ever 
be in your entire life and that completely blows  
my mind when I started recording this video a 
couple of minutes ago I'll never be that young  
again when I started taking on this perspective 
I knew that when I'm older when I'm 18 assuming  
I live to 80. I'd be super disappointed with 
myself if I wasted the rest of my days trying  
to live someone else's path purely because I 
was scared or fearful of something for me this  
is the most powerful perspective to take when 
it comes to big decisions that I'm often scared  
to take there's also another logical approach 
to take which is the concept of fear setting  
unlike goal setting which focuses on aspirations 
and achievements first setting encourages us to  
confront our anxieties directly by making a list 
of our fears articulating the worst case scenarios  
and then strategizing around them we can turn 
off fear into very actionable insights so the  
second part of this video now I wanted to talk to 
you through how I applied Tim ferriss's exercise  
when deciding whether or not to start this YouTube 
channel I'll just give you a high level overview  
of how it works and how I apply it and if you want 
to watch his full talk as well I'll leave a link  
to that below the first step is to take a pen and 
paper I recommend you write this down physically  
it has more of an impact when it's written down in 
your own handwriting rather than seeing it typed  
up on a computer at the top of the first page 
write what if I and finish it off with whatever  
it is that you are afraid of doing for example I 
wrote what if I put myself on social media media  
and started a YouTube channel you can also write 
something like what if I quit my job or what if I  
started that side hustle that I've been putting 
off for a while then below that there are three  
columns the first being Define this is where you 
write your worst case scenario these are all the  
worst things that can happen if you go ahead and 
do the thing that you write at the top of the page  
so for me it was what if my friends and family and 
colleagues see my channel and they find it funny  
and I get really embarrassed looking at other 
options if it's to quit your job maybe your worst  
fear is that you'll run out of money or maybe if 
it's to start a side hustle your worst fear could  
be what if it fails and it doesn't go anywhere I 
would have wasted all that time it's worst case  
scenarios that you can think of and you want to 
write down a whole list and everything you could  
think of that's stopping you from doing that thing 
the second column is prevent this is everything  
you can do to stop the worst case scenario from 
happening or reduce the likeliness of it happening  
so for example for me it was I'll focus on myself 
rather than what other people think of me and I'll  
gain validation and comfort for myself and the 
people that are closest to me if it's to quit your  
job and you fear of running out of money it could 
be to build up a bigger emergency fund or to get  
a part-time job whilst you pursue what you want 
to do or if it's to start a side hustle you can  
say okay can I see if there is proof of concept 
has anyone else made money doing what I'm doing  
and how has it worked out for them have they done 
something that I haven't thought about or do they  
have an advantage that made it work for them that 
may mean it might not necessarily work for me and  
then the third column is repair this is where you 
write down everything that you would do to repair  
the situation and what you would do if your worst 
case scenarios do come true so for me it was okay  
I will just stop posting and I'll hide my videos 
until I become comfortable with posting again it  
can also be if you run out of money then you'll 
rent out a room in your home or you'll sell your  
car or if it's a side hustle it'll be I'll learn 
all the skill sets that are transferable and I  
could apply to the next thing that I try to do 
once you fill out those three columns then that  
wraps up part one of the exercise part two two 
of this exercise is what might be the benefits  
of partial success or an attempt at what you wrote 
down at the top of page one imagine the scenario  
where you decide to quit your job to pursue a 
passion and it eventually becomes a successful  
Venture this newfound success would bring with a 
sense of Freedom that you never had before you can  
do what you love every day you'll no longer have 
to worry about asking for annual leave from your  
boss or worry about being told what to do when to 
come in when to finish work or an attempt at it  
might put you out of your comfort zone and through 
it you'll realize what your full potential is and  
what you're capable of doing that you would have 
never have known had you not attempted this thing  
and then part three is what would happen if you 
didn't take any action at all what would happen  
if you didn't change anything what would your 
life look like in five years in 10 years in 20  
years time if you didn't do anything and for me 
this was the bit that made me take action the  
last thing I wanted was to be in the same place 
in 20 years time as I am in now once you do this  
exercise you'll find that either number one yes 
your fears are legit and you may want to consider  
them before doing the thing that you wrote down 
or secondly your fears are actually not as big as  
you think and as the quote goes we suffer more 
in imagination than in reality if you're able  
to identify how your fear is showing up you can 
start to do something about it because what was  
before subconscious has now just become conscious 
and you have the ability to choose something else  
so this is an exercise that I've done multiple 
times and I keep doing whenever I'm worried about  
making a decision or I'm scared about what the 
outcome from that decision will be if you give  
it a go let me know how it works for you thank you 
for watching if you enjoyed this video you might  
also enjoy other videos that I have on making 
money and mindset and I'll link them over here"
l4ALo8obrDE,"over the last few years I have read almost every 
book that exists on money and investing from the  
classic books that cover the fundamentals like 
Rich Dad Poor Dad to the psychology focused ones  
like Think and Grow Rich to the books that go 
into investing like one up on Wall Street so in  
this video I'm going to break down the key things 
I have learned and taken away from all the books  
I've read some of them really surprised me because 
they contradicted to what I learned from my day  
job in Investment Banking and I'm curious to know 
if you shared the same perspective so let's start  
off with the basics and the most popular one and 
that is Rich Dad Poor Dad this is the classic of  
Classics and I can definitely see why it's so 
popular it covers the foundations for finance  
and money that isn't taught to us in school the 
premise of this book is based around the author's  
Two Dads his biological father who recommends 
getting a secure job taking the traditional path  
and retiring with the pension and then there's a 
second dad who is his best friend's father and he  
was a high school dropout he built a business 
Empire and was all about independent thinking  
and buying assets that make money for you and 
this book is what introduced me to the concept  
of assets and liabilities assets as it explains 
are things that put money into your pocket this  
could be anything from Investments like stocks 
and shares real estate side hustles or businesses  
that bring in extra income on the other hand 
liabilities are things that take money out of your  
pocket and they lose value over time and these 
are the things you want to avoid especially in the  
years that you're trying to build yourself up he 
says that when you think of your home as a primary  
investment you end up paying more for it and 
buying more house than you need and that sucks up  
a lot of your money in monthly installments that 
could have been used more profitably somewhere  
else so this is a really good book to begin 
your personal finance Journey explains the Core  
Concepts in a very digestible way and emphasizes 
the importance of giving each pound or each dollar  
a purpose and viewing it as an employee that 
is constantly working for you so this mindset  
clarifies the trade-off between in present 
expenses and future income because every dollar  
or every pound spent today is one that ultimately 
won't be able to work for you later down the road  
then he has a follow-up book which is the cash 
flow quadrant so there are hundreds of ways to  
earn money beyond the conventional nine-to-five 
job most people think that a stable job is the  
only legit and realistic way to Financial Security 
but this book will paint a whole new picture it  
makes you really understand the limitations of 
an I25 job and how you don't have to be tied to  
a desk for the rest of your life in order to 
make money and be financially free in fact it  
takes that one step further and says how relying 
purely on your job might just be the worst thing  
you do when it comes to making money and seeking 
Financial Freedom the cash flow quadrant that he  
discusses represents the four ways to earn money 
it's being an employee so working a nine-to-five  
job being self-employed or having a small business 
so for example if you're a dentist a freelancer  
and then there's being a big business owner and 
then finally being an investor and in this book  
he talks about how you can use this concept to 
Achieve Financial Freedom and which of these paths  
are most likely going to lead you down that road 
it's a good book to get your mind ticking with  
ideas but when it comes to actionable takeaways 
and things you can Implement I would recommend  
this book and that is the four hour work week 
by Tim Ferriss so when I read this or even when  
I saw the title I was initially quite skeptical I 
mean a four hour work week sounded too good to be  
true but as I got deeper into the book I realized 
it wasn't at all about working less it was purely  
about working smarter he talks about how anyone 
can live a retired millionaire Lifestyle by  
building their own business automating it and then 
collecting their income as they go and live their  
best life or the life that they would usually 
wait for years and years and years to live when  
they retire when you read the book it illustrates 
how something that is initially very far-fetched  
and seems like it's completely out of reach is 
actually a lot more achievable than you think so  
these two books go hand in hand cash flow quadrant 
opens your eyes to the possibilities of earning  
money outside the traditional job setup and then 
the four hour work week week gives you the tools  
to make that happen then we have the millionaire 
fast lane the point that the author makes in this  
book is that there is no such thing as get rich 
easy but there is such thing as get rich quick  
which is really interesting because you don't 
hear that very often he talks about the three  
paths in financial life the first path is the 
sidewalk and it is one where you spend more than  
you earn repeatedly which keeps you trapped in 
a cycle of being paycheck to paycheck the second  
part that he talks about is the slow lane and it's 
about taking the safer apart in life getting good  
grades getting a good job saving a portion of your 
paycheck every month and then putting that into  
Investments and eventually being able to retire at 
65 plus years old and the issue with this is that  
it is the slow game and you're ultimately trading 
your time for money and then there's path three  
and that is the fast lane and that is leveraging 
your time to create passive income so in other  
words investing your time in work that generates 
passive income by creating a product or a system  
that's capable of earning an income long after you 
original time investment has been put into it and  
it expands your income potential so what I really 
like about this book is that MJ the author while  
saying there is such thing as getting rich quick 
which can sound a bit scammy he keeps it very real  
in that it isn't possible without a lot of hustle 
a lot of hard work and a lot of discipline you  
need to be incredibly committed and even though 
it might be or might look like that you get rich  
really quick it's actually accumulation of years 
and experience and knowledge that gets you to that  
point next we have Think and Grow Rich this is one 
of the books that tends to have different opinions  
you either love it or you hate it there's hardly 
a middle ground with this book I've come across  
people who felt that this book was all fluff 
and didn't really deliver on what I promised  
they expected a clear actionable road map to 
wealth and so they were quite disappointed when  
they didn't find that and on the other hand there 
are people who credit this book with transforming  
their mindset and their financial lives for them 
it was like this light bulb moment that helped  
them unlock their limiting money believes and 
figure out what was holding them back so what's  
my take on it when it comes to success I believe 
mindset is everything if you approach life with  
a scarcity mindset thinking that there's never 
enough and that money is hard to come by then  
that is what you'll experience whereas on 
the other hand if you believe in abundance  
and that you're capable of achieving wealth your 
actions will align to those beliefs and Lead You  
towards success but and there is a big but mindset 
alone is not enough you can have the most positive  
abundance orientated mindset in the world but if 
you're not taking any action you're not going to  
get very far it's like having the best tools in 
the world but never using them to build anything  
you need both the right mindset and then also 
consistent focused action so if you're looking  
to improve the former and you're open to exploring 
your beliefs and digging deep into your mindset  
then this book is for you if you're not a fan of 
the philosophical approach and you're looking for  
a step-by-step guide to Building Wealth then 
you might want to skip it and go for some of  
the other ones that I mentioned in this video 
when it comes to the getting rich part next we  
have another classic which is the psychology of 
money so I have a whole video dedicated to this  
book and the lessons I've learned so I'll link 
that over here ultimately money is as much about  
psychology as it is about maths it's about how 
our minds perceive and interact with money our  
feelings towards money our past experiences 
with money and these things often overshadow  
the raw Financial knowledge that we have the 
most interesting part of this book for me is in  
relation to the fact of how often we misattribute 
the role of chance or luck in our financial lives  
so how's all the author talks about how most of us 
learn what to do and what not to do about money by  
studying the most exceptional financial success 
stories like the Bill Gates of the world and  
we think that we can replicate her but the more 
exceptional the story The more likely it is that  
luck played a bigger role in the outcome and so 
the fewer lessons you can actually take from it  
and Implement into your own life so he actually 
recommends paying attention to the patterns and  
not to the people so if one person took root 
a to get success but 10 people took root B to  
get success chances are root B is what's going to 
work for you because it's more likely that chance  
or luck played a role for the person that took 
Route a when it comes to money there are some  
key patterns and fundamentals that can apply to 
absolutely everyone and it doesn't require a whole  
amount of chance or luck and I've got a free guide 
that goes into this and on page 32 of that guide  
it goes through the most likely things that will 
guarantee your success when it comes to investing  
these are the things that have been proven Time 
and Time Again by investing experts that have  
trodden the path before us and things you need to 
consider again that guide is completely free if  
you want to check it out it's in the description 
box below there are also some fundamentals that  
I think most of the money books fail to mention 
and I'll go into that in a second but firstly now  
that we've covered the basics about how to manage 
your money what about the getting rich part how do  
we do that where do we put our money where should 
our money be channeled into to multiply its value  
Alex formosi introduced this concept of ignorance 
it's debt when it comes to Gathering knowledge  
he explains that the difference between your 
current level and earning 100 million is just the  
information that you haven't yet learned it's the 
fact that you don't know how to make 100 million  
and we can use this ignorance debt concept when 
it comes to investing as beginner as we tend to  
think we understand the topic a lot better than we 
actually do you may think that we have grasped all  
the intricacies and we're prepared to make really 
big decisions when it comes to money investing but  
this premature level of confidence can mislead us 
if we don't have a strong enough Foundation when  
it comes to our understanding so what are some of 
the books that can help us tackle this ignorance  
debt and that can start you on your investing 
journey two books the intelligent investor and  
girls that invest are great places to start the 
intelligent investor is a book Warren Buffett  
read when he was 19 and he still calls this 
the best book on investing that has ever been  
written the principles of this book are Timeless 
and it illustrates how investing over the long  
term does not require any specialist knowledge 
it doesn't require being super intelligent  
or having really deep Insight on anything it just 
requires two things and that is one a rational  
framework to make a decision and secondly not 
letting your emotions override your rational  
framework he covers how the market behaves the 
basic fundamentals of finance and how to maintain  
control of your psychology then the girls that 
invest is written by a friend of mine sem another  
really good book for the ultimate beginner who 
wants to understand why they should invest the  
basics and the terminology of investing and how 
to find your investing personality type and create  
a portfolio that matches that then there's a 
little book of Common Sense investing written  
by John Bogle who is the CEO of Vanguard and he 
invented index fans so naturally he argues how the  
winning strategy for beginner investors is simple 
invest in index funds and do it indefinitely he  
talks about why index funds outperform primary 
Alternatives and talks about the ideal asset  
allocation of stocks to bonds depending on your 
age I personally think this book is a little bit  
outdated for a number of reasons and I think that 
BOGO who is a bit conservative when it comes to  
asset allocation so a good follow-up to this book 
is the dandor investor and one up on Wall Street  
they both follow similar principles when it comes 
to the best investments and it's that the best  
investments are often right under your nose in the 
sense that they align with what we already know  
and engage with in our daily lives and based on 
this we actually have a huge advantage over Wall  
Street Pros I do agree with this to some extent so 
for instance I had inverted line treatment done on  
my teeth about five years ago and at the time I 
was super impressed with the product I was able  
to straighten my teeth without needing to wear 
silver braces the treatment was discreet and I  
was really happy with the results so I decided to 
look into the company further and I found that it  
was publicly listed I looked at the company's 
reports and I decided to buy the stock that  
investment turned out to be the investment that 
I've made the biggest return on out of everything  
that I've invested in and it was purely from me 
being a customer and seeing the impact first hand  
so I do somewhat agree that the average investor 
has the potential to one-up professionals but it  
isn't as simple as just okay be a customer 
it requires a lot more research to do before  
investing in that stock one common thread amongst 
all of these books and across all legit genuine  
Finance advice is that there is no shortcut 
to success and that there are no shortcuts to  
getting rich it requires discipline it requires 
persistence and the ability to control your  
emotions when it comes to money or when it comes 
to those things in life what I have found that at  
least from the money Focus books very few touch on 
the importance of putting money towards yourself  
before investing in the stock market and I guess 
those are two very different topics but the truth  
is investing in most cases is a very long and very 
slow game whereas investing in yourself whether  
that's your ability to manage money your ability 
to make more money through a business through a  
side hustle that is more important when it comes 
to the short term although it does require a lot  
more work and discipline and knowledge if you want 
to go down this route I have plenty more videos  
that can get you started and I've made a playlist 
that I'll link up over here that you can look at  
and I'll leave you with that but before I close 
this video off can you do me a favor over 75 of  
people who watch my videos haven't subscribed 
to the channel and that is abnormally high so  "
YCHAqn4mMpM,"over the past 13 years I've learned a lot about 
money I've picked up lessons from reading books  
working in the banking sector studying accounting 
and a lot of general trial and error so in this  
video I wanted to share with you seven key pieces 
of money advice for someone in their 20s and 30s  
these tips are based on things that I did well and 
things that I would do differently if given the  
chance to go back in time if you're new here I'm 
Nisha and my channel is all about personal finance  
and Building Wealth so let's get into it number 
one don't save too much this is one that I see so  
many people do and I just think if you're in your 
20s or 30s you want to avoid it you want to avoid  
a situation where you're just sitting on cash and 
not doing anything with it at this stage you're  
kind of at the beginning of what we can call your 
income trajectory and you have years ahead of you  
to save money so although it's very tempting to 
start saving as much as possible straight away  
as soon as you start earning it's also a really 
crucial time to consider reinvesting that money  
back into you as this is an essential time to 
shape the trajectory of your financial Natural  
Life by investing in yourself your knowledge your 
skills you can make your path to higher earnings  
steeper as you become more valuable whether 
it's through your job or through a skill set  
that you've acquired for your business venture by 
putting that money towards yourself and then you  
can save a percentage of an even higher income at 
that point point two there's no need to gatekeep  
I come across people who are very secretive with 
their knowledge or with the information they have  
and they just don't want to share it with anyone 
because everything seems like a competition to  
them and to be honest this winds me up a little 
bit I was watching a podcast with Mr Beast and I  
like the way he gave this example he said if 
there's a world where it's just you working  
solo and you work 12 hours every day and you're 
grinding and then you make a mistake and then  
you learn from it and then you make another 
mistake and then you learn from it that's one  
World Imagine another world where you have four 
friends who are deeply grinding in the same thing  
that you are friend number one makes a mistake on 
Thursday and then teaches everyone else on Friday  
friend number two makes another mistake that week 
and then teaches everyone else the week after and  
you're constantly learning and building each each 
other in as you're going you're learning from each  
other's mistakes so after a year you're two years 
ahead of the guy who is solo helping someone else  
is not going to take anything away from you being 
afraid to help people or being afraid to give  
information away that's a scarcity mindset rather 
than an abundance mindset and that in itself will  
hold you back point three upskill yourself in 
unique ways being wealthy isn't necessarily about  
how much money you have or about how much money 
you're saving the true meaning of wealth is if  
everything was stripped away from you you lost 
your business you lost your job you lost your  
assets can you then build yourself back up the 
only way you can do that is through your skill  
set and your knowledge and so obscaling yourself 
ideally in unique ways is one of the best things  
you can do as a young adult buy uniquely I 
don't mean just getting more qualifications  
or credentials in your current failure I also mean 
creatively blending your existing skills with new  
ones that are in completely different fields and 
the more unique the pairing the more invaluable  
you are take the healthcare sector for example 
doctors dentists they used to be limited by the  
number of patients who physically walked into 
their Clinic that's all they really had access  
to but now I see so many that are leveraging 
digital platforms like social media YouTube to  
spread their knowledge and by doing this they're 
massively increasing the number of people they can  
reach you want to find skills that are complex so 
they're difficult for others to replicate quickly  
and also that adds value or solves a problem and 
then once you've got those two you want to infuse  
your personality into it and the reason why I say 
a blend of all three is because we're moving into  
a future where AI is likely going to take over 
a lot of things from content creation to data  
analysis so bringing in your personality becomes 
more valuable than it's ever been AI can gather  
information they can present information but it 
cannot fully replicate emotional intelligence or  
specific unique perspectives so in other words the 
you in what you do is still Irreplaceable point  
four turn your active income into passive income 
this is one that I adapted quite late but it is  
life-changing most of us start our careers working 
a nine-to-five job that often don't offer a huge  
amount of scalability and there's this notion that 
you need to exchange your time to make money and  
I'm assuming about 90 of people watching this 
fall into this category one of the things that  
I would highly recommend is to rethink that money 
equation the ultimate goal is to leverage your  
existing skills your existing Knowledge from 
your day job into sources of passive income  
so an example that I used in another video Steve 
shoga he's a developer by day and what he did he  
packaged everything he knew and learned through 
his day job into an ebook and from that he made  
2.3 million dollars he realized that if a typical 
developer could get better at the design element  
of development it would massively enhance their 
career it's pretty specific it's not a huge Niche  
but it's one that he has a lot of skills and 
expertise in and he used what he does for a  
living and made that into something that's passive 
and something that's scalable and I do think there  
are so many careers where you can lean into 
this even if it doesn't seem glaringly obvious  
at first like accounting who would have thought 
that accounting is something that can be scaled  
but that's kind of what I've done here through 
this YouTube channel it's all the knowledge that  
I've gained through my accountancy qualification 
through my experience in the banking sector and  
then I've presented it in a way that appeals to 
the mass there is a market for most things so if  
you can think about what you're already doing and 
how can you scale that and make it passive one way  
to think about this is through the next point 
which is to look for Rising tides in the world  
of business and money timing is everything there's 
often a golden window a specific time frame where  
diving into a particular Market can give you 
first mover Advantage it's all about spotting  
Trends or patterns before they become mainstream 
and then capitalizing on that foresight take Tesla  
for example they had the vision to see a trend 
emerging in the car industry cars were gradually  
becoming energy efficient and so whilst other 
companies were warming up to the idea Tesla  
recognized this Gap and just jumped in and filled 
it they saw where the industry was going and they  
put themselves at the Forefront now many other 
car companies have caught up and so consequently  
Tesla is being forced to reduce its car our prices 
but they took the chance at the time and made the  
most of it same another example is chat gbt when 
it first came about there were people who got to  
grips with it really quickly and were able to spot 
the trend and make a lot of money from it from  
teaching other people how to use that and teaching 
other people how to make the most out of it same  
goes for social media as a whole lot it seems like 
social media is everywhere I do believe we're in  
this still huge growth phase where not everyone 
is utilizing it fast forward five years ten years  
down the line and it'll be a given that if you're 
self-employed or you have a business you will need  
some sort of social media presence but spotting 
these Rising Tides early gives you first mover  
Advantage number six open an investment account 
there is this famous saying that as someone is  
sitting in the shade today because someone planted 
a tree a long time ago if you're in the UK open up  
an Isa if you're in the US Open up a Roth IRA as 
soon as possible after turning 18. these are taxed  
Advantage investment accounts where the money you 
make is tax free the reason for doing this as soon  
as you can isn't to make loads of money straight 
away because chances are as a young adult you  
don't have a huge amount of money to put straight 
into the stock market instead is to understand  
the process of investing your money in stocks 
and shares so that you can overcome the mental  
block that often stops people from investing many 
people in their late 20s and 30s they make good  
money but they've never thought about investing 
because they just think that it's reserved for  
the ultra wealthy and that doing it is risky and 
it's too difficult so starting small and picking  
up the habits even if it's just with five or ten 
dollars that can remove the mental and emotional  
barrier so it's better to start investing when 
you're young than waiting till you make loads  
of money and then making mistakes at that point 
once you open up your investment account you'll  
want to start investing and that leaves me 2.7 
which is invest in index funds really simple yet  
really effective way to diversify your portfolio 
and increasing your earnings over time is through  
index funds by purchasing an index fund you're 
essentially buying a small piece of a large number  
of companies all at once so for example if you're 
investing in the S P 500 Index Fund then you're  
investing in the top performing 500 companies in 
the U if you're investing in the ftse 100 it's  
the top 100 companies in the UK you're investing 
in these all at once in one go for most people  
this is far better than picking individual stocks 
because you diversify your money by splitting it  
through these 500 companies or so overall index 
funds are a good choice for anyone who wants to  
invest in the stock market without taking on too 
much risk and starting early means you can benefit  
from compounding but I do always like to highlight 
that this is a long game and so don't expect to  
become an overnight millionaire from investing in 
index funds which is why I've put this seventh on  
my list I do believe in investing in yourself 
and increasing your earnings potential before  
going down the index fund route before I leave you

t56hRpx29dM,"a common question people ask when buying a 
property is whether they should buy a house  
or a flat on one side you might think that 
buying a house is the best option because  
it means you will have an asset that will increase 
in value over time but on the other side you might  
think that buying a flat is a better option 
because it's cheaper and means you can get on  
the property ladder quicker so in this video I'm 
going to talk about the financial implications of  
buying a house versus a flat the key things you 
need to consider before buying and find me the  
non-financial factors to take into consideration 
both if you're looking to buy for yourself or if  
you're looking to buy as an investment I'll also 
cover the one thing that I always look for when  
buying a property regardless of whether it's 
a flat or a house if you're new here I'm Misha  
I'm a qualified accountant and this is part of a 
series of real estate videos on my channel let's  
start with what is the difference if you're buying 
a house it's typically going to be a freehold  
which means you own the house and you also own 
the ground or the land on which that house sits  
forever or at least until you decide to sell the 
house if you're buying a flat it's most likely a  
leasehold so if you buy a leasehold flat you own 
that flat but someone else owns the ground or the  
land on which that building of flats sits on and 
that person or that company is the Freeholder then  
there's also Sheriff Freehold which is a blend of 
the two so you still own a lease of your flat but  
you also own a show of the ground alongside other 
people in the building so if there are five flats  
in this block you will own the lease on your flat 
but also you'll own 20 of the share of the ground  
alongside the other flat owners this isn't as 
common as Freehold and leasehold so to keep  
things simple in this video I'm not going to go 
into this option now let's look at what you need  
to consider if you're buying this as an investment 
and you want to make money on it people tend to go  
for Flats over houses as they're generally cheaper 
and so subsequently the gross yield seems Higher  
by gross yield I mean your profit before taking 
into account all the expenses and the costs the  
issue here is that the gross yield can be a 
bit deceiving when it comes to Flats because  
the ongoing costs of owning a leasehold flat are 
higher there are two costs that come with almost  
all lease of flats and the first is ground run 
remember we said as a leaseholder owner you own  
the flat for a specific period of time and the 
Freeholder owns the ground that that flat sits on  
that essentially means you're the tenant and you 
have to pay ground rent to the Freeholder ground  
rent used to be really cheap it used to be nominal 
but recently it has become quite expensive for my  
flat in London I pay 400 pounds a year and then 
that amount is reviewed and adjusted according  
to the lease every 15 years so you want to check 
in your lease what you'll be paying for ground  
rent beforehand because this can really add up the 
second cost to take into account with a leasehold  
flat is the service charge and this can be painful 
when you own a house or the maintenance such as  
the repairs on a roof or maintaining the garden 
that is your responsibility as the Freeholder you  
can find your own and contractors you can get the 
cheapest contractors you can arrange everything  
yourself and you have full control over the 
entire process and whether or not you even want  
to get that thing fixed or you want to leave it 
broken when you have a flat you are responsible  
for the inside of the flat but all the communal 
areas are the freeholders responsibility so this  
includes the corridors the lifts the stairway the 
lobby communal Gardens parking spaces so anything  
that happens to those areas the Freeholder 
will sort that out and arrange but they will  
charge you as a leaseholder a service charge for 
doing so because they are doing it for the entire  
building and because they're doing it on a larger 
scale this tends to be more expensive and is out  
of your control how cheap you could get it for 
again this really adds up for example the lift  
in my building has broken multiple times and lift 
repairs cost tens of thousands of pounds so the  
Freeholder then pays for that upfront but passes 
that cost onto each of the leaseholders or each  
of the flat owners in the building those are the 
two main hidden costs that need to be taken to  
account both if you're buying the place to live in 
yourself so you want to make sure you've budgeted  
for those course and also if you're looking to 
buy this as an investment property because you  
want to make sure you're taking those costs into 
your calculations to decide whether or not this  
makes sense in terms of a return perspective 
while a flat can be cheaper to buy a freehold  
house is often cheaper to maintain than a flat 
with a service charge something else you want to  
consider is the ownership period for a freehold 
house you own it forever you do not need to hand  
it over to anyone after any specific period of 
time it's yours until you decide to sell it with a  
lease this is yours for a specific period of time 
it can be 100 years or 125 years as we discussed  
this does not usually impact the value of your 
property at the start but if that lease term or  
the number of years left on the lease goes below 
70 years it's hard to then get a mortgage on it so  
if you're looking to sell it that will impact who 
can buy your place and consequently it will impact  
the property's value and the amount of money you 
can get for it now you can pay the Freehold start  
to extend the sleeves on your flat but you must 
have lived in the property for a certain period of  
time to exercise that right and it's likely you'd 
have to pay the Freeholder to extend the lease so  
again this is something else you want to consider 
into all your calculations there is something  
called a virtual Freehold for flats and that's a 
999 year lease so this doesn't have any ownership  
issues per se I mean you're not going to live 
past 999 years it's not an issue that you have  
to worry about in your lifetime but at the end of 
the day it is still a leasehold so the ground rent  
and the service charge do still apply the third 
thing you want to consider is alterations whether  
you're buying a house or a flat you do want it to 
increase in value over time generally the prices  
in most big cities increase over time but you can 
also accelerate that increase in value by making  
alterations so adding floor space redoing it up 
improving it this can all increase the value of  
your property and if you own a freehold house 
this is easier to do you may depending on what  
you're doing need approval from the local Council 
but you have more freedom to make changes and add  
value to your property with a leasehold flat you 
need permission from the local Council but you  
also need permission from the Freeholder to make 
any alterations and that just adds another layer  
of complexity for example if you want to convert 
a one bedroom flat into a two-bedroom flat you  
need approval from the Freeholder and again they 
may ask you to pay a lump sum in return for their  
consent so the lease of a lease off flat also 
stops you from doing certain things with the  
place so for example with my flap my lease with 
the Freeholder stops me from renting it out on  
Airbnb whereas with a freehold house that's not an 
issue you have full control over almost everything  
that you want to do okay now let's move on to 
the non-money related things to consider and the  
one thing that I always look for but before we get 
into that if you're buying this place as somewhere  
for you to live and you don't really care about 
any income or any capital appreciation or how much  
the place goes up in value and it's not really 
an asset or an investment for you then it really  
doesn't matter forget about everything and just 
go buy some something that you like and that makes  
you happy secondly if you just want the Peace of 
Mind of owning a place rather than renting then  
as flats are generally cheaper you can get on the 
property ladder quicker you do want to take into  
account all the costs of the maintenance though 
and make sure you've accounted for that within  
your budget and also this whole buy versus rent 
debate that's another topic altogether I have a  
whole dedicated video on that which I'll link up 
here if you're toying between the two and which  
one you want to go for and thirdly I wanted to add 
this tip in because I always make sure I look for  
this before I buy somewhere and that is to make 
sure that the place that I'm buying has a south  
facing Garden or a south facing balcony as the 
sun rises in the East and sets in the west the  
south side of many houses will see most hours 
of sunlight during the day so that's really  
important if you're looking for someone to live 
for yourself the more sun the better in my opinion  
I don't create as many real estate property videos 
as I used to because I'm not sure they resonate  
with as many of you but if you do want me to make 
more of these then let me know in the comments and  
I'll release the other ones that I have planned on 
home ownership thank you for watching I'll leave  
you with some other property videos that you 
may find useful and I'll leave them over here"
jyw8MfQh3DA,"hi everyone welcome back to this channel in this 
video I'm going over seven purchases that have  
massively improved my life let's get into it 
number one on the list is my Amazon Kindle so  
I bought this for around $80 and it has been the 
purchase that has had the biggest difference to  
my life as soon as I see a book that I like 
or that I've been recommended I buy it on my  
Kindle straight away and then I start reading 
it immediately and because of this I read so  
many more books than I would have otherwise if 
I want to get through a book really quickly in  
a day or two then I'd buy it on my Kindle and I 
would also at the same time listen to the audio  
version of it I know this sounds a bit strange but 
I get through BS probably three times faster this  
way it's also really handy if you're traveling 
it can fit anywhere it's really light and easy  
to carry around this one is the standard basic 
Kindle but if you want to spend more money on  
one and get some additional features then there's 
also the paper white and the Kindle Oasis number  
on my way to work it didn't take me very long to 
make my money back on this I broke even in about 2  
months when compared to the cost of buying coffee 
out I also bought this milk frother as well which  
is really good I make iced coffee using it it's 
nice it's compact the whole thing is super quick  
to make highly recommend if you're a coffee person 
number three leverage not a specific purchase but  
something I now regularly spend my money on and 
I wish I understood and spent money on this thing  
earlier leverage in this sense is about finding 
ways to get more from what you have so finding  
ways you can 10 times your output from two times 
the effort so using this YouTube channel as an  
example up until a few months ago I was doing 
absolutely everything on my own the editing the  
accounting the bookkeeping the website and the 
landing page P figuring out how to use an email  
campaign The Branding everything I was doing on my 
own and I didn't even know how to do 99% of this  
so I was also teaching myself learning through 
YouTube videos reading books and it was really  
slowing me down and so I made my first hire and 
that was the biggest leverage decision I could  
have made at the time it completely changed the 
game for me now I can focus on what I can do what  
I'm good at which is the script the filming 
the recording and then everything else that  
someone else can do probably and in half the time 
I Outsource it and that includes having an editor  
having someone edit my videos has now saved me 
another 5 to 7 hours a week so these are some  
of the more expensive financial decisions but have 
had the biggest impact when it comes to Output per  
effort leverage can be applied in different ways 
when it comes to multiplying your output it can  
be a system that automates your task or it can be 
a software or an app that speeds up your workflow  
which is where the sponsor of today's video really 
nicely Falls in and that is clean my Mac I have  
been using clean my Mac for for years and I've 
also now got both of my sisters on it and they  
love it it will completely polish up a sow Mac 
in 2 minutes it'll make it work as quickly and  
as efficiently as a brand new one the smart scan 
does clean up malware removal and speed up Allin  
one combo at a click of a button and there is 
also the menu app which is a little dashboard with  
informative monitors about every aspect of your 
max performance so things like what's your battery  
temperature how much storage space do you have 
left what's the speed of the internet connection  
again you can see all of this information in one 
view I came across clean my Mac 3 years ago when  
my last MacBook was dying on me and I was Panic 
Google searching for a solution that didn't cost  
a arm and a leg and it extended the life of that 
Mac for another year I highly recommend it but  
try it yourself you can try it completely for free 
using a 7-Day free trial so clean up your Mac use  
all the features see if you like it and if you do 
like it as much as I do you could also get 20% off  
of your full subscription using the link in my bio 
number four investing in my icky guy this isn't a  
physical item but spending money to find my iy 
guy has had a huge impact on my day-to-day and  
the more I speak to people about side hustles and 
finding a passion project outside of their day job  
the more I realize that everyone is in search 
of their iy guy if you don't know iy guy is a  
Japanese term that is defined as something that 
gives a person a sense of purpose or a reason for  
living this diagram is one representation of 
iy guy and it shows how the four key elements  
intersect it's what you love what you're good at 
what you can be paid for and what the world needs  
and in the middle is your sense of purpose almost 
like your money making superpower I truly truly  
believe that putting in the time and investment 
to find your iy guy and nurturing and developing  
these four elements is one of the best investments 
you can make for instance say you found a passion  
for a specific activity or skill but you can get 
better at it so you're missing one of the elements  
is the bit that you're good at you can spend then 
money on workshops on classes on self-education to  
better those skills or if it's something else that 
you are already good at and you love doing but you  
don't know how to make money for it you don't know 
how to get paid for it then you can invest your  
money and time in the sales and marketing part 
so learning how to sell your offering in a way  
that it reaches the Right audience who values what 
you provide and is willing to pay for it everyone  
has something that they love doing and that they 
can turn into a money-making stream number five  
is anything that separates you from the floor 
essentially if it holds your way it's worth  
spending money on so this includes a mattress 
a sofa an office chair they say that if you  
live until you're 99 years old then you would have 
spent 33 years of that sleeping so you may as well  
spend your money on something that is going to a 
help your posture in the long run and B help you  
get a great night's sleep the same with an office 
chair the amount of hours you spend sitting at  
your desk it will be silly not to spend money on 
a high quality chair that again holds your posture  
you may not feel the direct impact in the short 
term but over the long term you'll be thankful  
for it number six investing in Solo travel one 
of the most rewarding Financial purchases I made  
was a solo flight ticket to Barley last year it 
was the first time I traveled alone I've always  
wanted to do it but I've always made up an excuse 
or found a reason not to and instead to go with my  
partner my friends my family I had 2 months off 
between jobs last year and no one could get the  
time off work to join me in that period so it 
was a perfect time to take the leap and I'm so  
glad that I did I mean traveling with people is 
cool you create shared memories you Embrace new  
cultures together you have someone to hang around 
and talk to but traveling alone really pushes you  
out of your comfort zone it develops you as a 
person and gives you a whole new perspective on  
life there are also so many psychological benefits 
from spending time alone you don't even have to  
jump on a flight to experience this even taking 
a road trip or spending a weekend in solitude  
can have the same impact it really teaches you 
the comfort of being alone and self-acceptance  
number seven investing in my health I've never 
ever regretted spending money on my mental or my  
physical health and if you don't invest in these 
two things you can forget pretty much everything  
else on the list because it really is the baseline 
or the foundation for everything else in your life  
if you're not staying healthy and working out 
it's going to have an impact on your ability to  
work on your ability to perform on your ability to 
enjoy life it have a KnockOn effect on everything  
else and the same goes with your mental health we 
tend to be so comfortable with spending money on  
tangible items and on things that we can see but 
when it comes to spending money on things that  
we can't we find it very difficult to part with 
our money when really our enjoyment on most other  
things in life depends on that non-tangible item 
I've spent money on therapy before and it really  
helped me understand what was impacting me and 
why I was feeling a certain way with my life at  
a certain period of my time and it all came down 
to not knowing what my icky guy was referring back  
to an earlier Point therapy can really help you 
understand or dissect what it is that you're going  
through it's not the cheapest purchase on the 
list but there are ways you can get it for Less  
maybe through your workplace health insurance 
which is what I did and is definitely worth  
exploring so those are some of my best purchases 
and how I spend money on the things I love I also  
have a video on how I save on the things that 
I don't and I'll leave that over here thank  
you for watching don't forget to subscribe if you 
haven't already and I'll see you in my next video"
CRPiqu2EL4A,"at an old Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting 
Charlie Munger was asked what his best advice for  
investing and Building Wealth is his response was 
the first 100 000 is a bit but you gotta do it I  
don't care what you have to do find a way to 
get your hands on 100 000 and after that you  
can ease off the gas a little bit that first 100 
000 is for most people the most difficult part  
of creating wealth and so in this video I want to 
share with you my formula how I accelerated saving  
and investing my first 100 000 and hopefully this 
will give you some ideas in how you can do it  
too if you're new here I'm Nisha I'm a qualified 
accountant and on this channel we talk about all  
things money and self-development let's get into 
it the very first thing I did before anything else  
was increase my savings cap you can only save 
as much as you earn if you earn three thousand  
dollars a month the maximum that you could ever 
save if you literally did not spend a thing is  
three thousand dollars that's your savings cap the 
only way to increase that savings cap is by making  
more money and so that is where my primary focus 
was when I was going for this Milestone there  
are so many ways you can do this buy and sell 
something on the side start a side hustle take on  
extra freelancing work but honestly the quickest 
and easiest way to do this is by just getting a  
pay rise through your day job and so that is what 
I did a job should either be there to learn or be  
there to earn ideally both but for me at different 
points in my career I focused on one or the other  
and if I haven't got either I've switched jobs the 
biggest pay risers I saw was when I moved between  
organizations between 30 to 40 percent pay jump 
which for me was Far higher than what I got in  
the years that I stayed in the same organization 
so I have a full video which breaks down exactly  
what I made and what my base salary was every 
year for the last nine years I'll link that over  
here and that shows you what I did at what point 
in my career to ultimately increase the savings  
cap something that you'll notice from that video 
is that even though the ghost salary might look  
high what my take home is after tax is another 
thing altogether saving your first 100 000 is  
hard and if you're relying on just one source of 
income to be able to do that it's going to be a  
very very long game especially after taking into 
account all the other fixed costs that you have  
rent or a mortgage bills groceries it will take 
most people years and years which leads me to the  
second way of increasing your earnings potential 
and that is through exploring other options and  
better yet ones where you can keep more of what 
you make there are a million different ways to get  
to the same destination and so once my salary was 
at a certain level to get to the next level I used  
my salary as leverage to buy my first investment 
property I say investment property but I knew that  
I was going to in fact live there three four five 
years later and my tenant also knew about this so  
I'll explain my thought process behind this in 
the next part of the video but ultimately this  
decision meant I was able to get another source of 
income through rental income and again increasing  
my savings cap so you want to think about how 
you can buy assets or what assets you could buy  
to generate additional cash flow at the same time 
I was also exploring with different side hustles  
and developing skills that would help me increase 
my income outside of my day job and I can tell you  
I failed so so many times at this maybe I'll 
make a whole video on all the businesses that  
failed because at many times it felt like I was 
going backwards I'd be putting money into these  
businesses but no money was coming back out so I'd 
keep going back to the drawing board and starting  
over and over again try loads of things and when 
you fail fail fast and fail forward every time  
I failed I took those learnings with me to the 
next thing I tried and then if that failed to  
the next thing I tried and I kept going until it 
all added up and led me to something that did work  
which leads me to the second thing I did which is 
a absolute must if you're trying to get to the 100  
000 and that is to creatively live below your 
means I use the word creatively because I see  
so much personal finance advice centered around 
depriving yourself and I don't want to Advocate  
that lifestyle because even though being Frugal 
and saving resonates with more people there are so  
many other ways to live below your means without 
having to live like a bro student for your entire  
life and money should be used as a tool to create 
the life that you want not take away from it and a  
lot of this is about just being smart about how 
you're using your money so I mentioned earlier  
about buying an investment property that later 
became a place that I lived I probably would not  
have been able to buy that property if I didn't a 
have the massive advantage of having a reasonably  
well paid job and secondly being able to live at 
home with my parents for the first few years of  
my working life and even after that I bought the 
property I lived at home for a bit longer because  
the opportunity cost of living in that place 
versus renting it out was around 2 500 pounds  
a month now I get it there are so many reasons why 
people can't do this you don't get along with your  
parents you want to move out and be independent 
they don't live near where you want to stay  
whatever it is for me being able to firstly spend 
more time with them at that point in my life and  
secondly through it being able to save more really 
helped me accelerate getting to that Milestone and  
going back to Charlie munger's quote find a way 
to get your hands on the first 100K do whatever  
it takes this was my way it definitely isn't the 
only way one of my friends bought a two-bedroom  
flat at the same time but she wanted to move 
out so her way to get her hands on the first 100  
000 and live below her means was to rent out the 
spare bedroom living below your means doesn't just  
mean not being able to do something it also means 
being creative about how you can afford to do that  
thing and one of the best ways to do this is by 
analyzing where the biggest costs in your life are  
and think about how you could get the same thing 
but for Less I have a free save your first 100  
000 tracker that is in the description box 
below and the whole premise behind this is  
to see how and where you're spending across an 
entire year when you can visibly see exactly  
where each pound or each dollar is going you 
become a lot more mindful of where the biggest  
costs are and then your brain really starts to 
unlock ways and ideas in how you can live below  
your means so take some time to look at this 
and figure out how you can increase the gap  
between your earnings and your expenses as much 
as possible and then with the difference you can  
do the next stage which is letting it multiply 
the first 100 000 is the hardest but the reason  
why there's such a focus on it is because once 
you save and invest that amount the next 100  
000 and the 100 000 after becomes a lot easier 
than the first because of the power of compounding  
think about it someone with 1000 and someone with 
a hundred thousand can be investing in the exact  
same thing returning eight percent per year the 
first person will make eighty dollars after year  
one and the second person would make eight 
thousand and then that money gets reinvested  
and the difference just keeps getting greater 
and compounds which is why other than what you  
need to keep aside for your emergency fund any 
additional savings should be invested to benefit  
from that compounding early on you don't need 
a hundred thousand to start investing you can  
start investing for as little as one pound or 
one Euro through apps like trading 212 who are  
very kindly sponsoring this video trading 212 
is a great app and lets you trade stocks funds  
ETFs and foreign exchange even if you don't have 
enough money to start investing seriously you can  
build the habits early on so if you're new to 
the world of investing you can use fake money  
and invest fake money which tracks what the market 
is doing in real time so you can see if I invested  
100 pounds into x what that would be worth in 
weeks months years down the line this gets you  
comfortable with the Habit investing so that 
when you're ready you can start to use the real  
mode what I also like about trading 212 is their 
pies feature where you can follow other people's  
pies so someone may have created an investment pie 
for example 20 in a growth fund 30 and an energy  
fund to 50 and the S P 500 and you can see the 
performance of those pies and copy those pies into  
your own account they have also recently added a 
new feature for multi-currency accounts usually  
if you're investing in a us-based fund where a 
large portion of the stock market is you'd have  
to convert your money and incur FX fees every time 
you do this if you're depositing from Europe but  
now you can actually withdraw and deposit from the 
same currency of your bank account's currency so  
you don't have to pay your bank conversion fees 
and it effectively allows you to manage foreign  
exchange volatility by letting you hold multiple 
currencies through the App instead if you want  
to try out trading 212 you can get a free share 
worth up to 100 pounds when you use the code Nisha  
nischa so thank you training212 for sponsoring 
this video ultimately saving your first 100  
000 may seem Out Of Reach but if you really put 
it at the Forefront and focus everything you  
do around it even if it means sacrificing some 
things here and there you can really accelerate  
your journey to Building Wealth I'd love to know 
where you stand in your financial building stage  
and what you're doing to get to that six figure 
savings Mark if you want some ideas on what you  
can cut back to save more and invest more without 
cutting back on your quality of life I have a  
video that's completely dedicated to that I'll 
link that over here thank you for watching don't

oVpUgcL2kxU,"through being in some form of Finance related 
environment for over 13 years three years  
studying finance and then a further nine years 
working in banking one of the key skills I've  
learned is how to spot the signs that contribute 
to financial success so in this video I wanted to  
share with you four things that tend to dictate 
whether or not you're doing well financially how  
reliable those four things are and how to stay on 
track number one are you playing the right game  
there are two games you can play to measure 
your financial success and one of the main  
reasons people tend to feel behind financially 
is because they are playing the wrong one they  
are playing the status game where we're all 
trying to one-up each other I really like the  
way Nevada talks about the status game he says 
the problem is that to win a status game you  
have to put somebody else down and that's why you 
should avoid playing status games in life because  
it makes you a very competitive it makes you a 
angry person you're always fighting to put other  
people down to put yourself up the status game is 
an external ranking to everyone else the size of  
your home the brand of your shoes and everything 
else that you can see and compare yourself to on  
social media for instance say I bought a Porsche 
that will only improve my status if you don't have  
one if everyone else has one it doesn't help me 
climb up the ladder so you're using other people  
as a reference to where you are the issue is that 
when you start playing this game and comparing  
internally with everyone else's projections 
you're constantly going to feel on edge because  
someone else has to lose for someone else to be 
able to win and there's a sentence in the book  
The Millionaire Next Door which reads wealth is 
not the same as income if you make a good income  
each year and spend it all you're not getting 
wealthier you are just living high that leads  
me to the second game you can play which is the 
wealth game this isn't about what everyone else  
can see but instead it's about what's going on 
behind the scenes it's the money in the bank that  
is being invested into assets is the business that 
you're trying to build on the side it's the money  
that you're spending on self-development it's all 
the things that have a positive Roi and that can  
ultimately buy you freedom and buy you the power 
to live life on your own terms the key is to make  
sure your evaluation of financial success isn't 
based on the status game once you wrap your head  
around that you will realize you're doing far or 
better than you think you are financially because  
the status game is only like a movie trailer it 
shows you the best bits and leaves the rest out  
that leads me to the second point which is how 
much should you be earning one way to know where  
you stand financially is by looking at the average 
wages and according to the ons the average annual  
salary in the UK is 27 756 pounds and the average 
salary Nationwide in the US according to Forbes is  
59 428 the truth is these numbers actually make 
very little difference to how we see ourselves  
because firstly according to research it's our own 
friends and our peers that have a bigger influence  
on our self-evaluation or financial excess rather 
than society as a whole and secondly no matter how  
much we earn it's psychologically easier to feel 
bad bad about that number then feel good about it  
there is a concept called loss aversion which 
is that the pain of losing is psychologically  
twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining for 
instance if we found a hundred dollars on the  
ground we would be thrilled it would make our day 
but if we lost that same 100 our pain would be far  
bigger than the initial joy that we found in the 
same thing according to a research paper on social  
comparison the same concept can be applied to our 
earnings if you found out you earn more money than  
your friends or your colleagues you might feel 
slightly more content with your earnings but  
that feeling would fade pretty quickly but on 
the other hand if you found out you're earning  
less money than them that would have a way bigger 
impact on your happiness levels and you'd feel a  
lot less satisfied with how much you're making we 
can be outperforming 99 of the people around us  
but if there's even one person in our Circle who 
appears to be doing better it can make us question  
our own success and the worst part is without 
knowing this psychologically will keep us in a  
never-ending cycle of discontent and as we rise 
through the ranks and make more money and level  
up so to speak so does our peer group and The 
Benchmark We compare ourselves to so how does  
one escape this I'll go into the actionable 
points that you can do in just a moment but  
firstly let's talk about rule number three which 
is getting the three fundamentals right number  
one the first of the three fundamentals is to be 
fully aware of your relationship with money this  
means knowing your Financial Health your income 
and your expenses and then finding ways to live  
below your means in other words increase your 
income and or reduce your outgoing so that you  
have enough money left over to save or invest 
in some form of another one way to do this is  
through using a Tracker that can show you where 
you stand financially and if you're spending less  
than you earn I have a free one that you can use 
in my description box which really Dives deep into  
every category of your life so you can be fully 
aware of your relationship with money that leads  
me to the second fundamental which is having an 
emergency buffer this is a specific amount of  
savings you would have access to in the case of 
an emergency and having this one thing alone sets  
you way ahead of a lot of the population in fact 
40 of the people in the UK don't even have one  
month of living expenses to support them if they 
lost their income and only 39 of Americans could  
cover a one thousand dollar unexpected expense 
if you have a healthy emergency fund tucked away  
even just one month of living expenses to start 
with you're doing a lot better than most people  
and then the final part of these three is far 
easier said than done especially in the current  
climate and that is to have manageable debt this 
isn't just about using debt to buy things you  
don't need it also means not finding yourself in 
a position where debt is the only way you can play  
your bills on time the average American has 32 878 
dollars in depth not including their mortgage and  
UK credit card debt is at an all-time high 46 of 
25 to 34 year olds have taken out an additional  
credit card which according to UK economists such 
just that people are boring more to protect their  
Lifestyles from The Surge and inflation so this 
just goes to show if you're able to save a portion  
of your income have an emergency fund and you're 
able to pay your bills on time without going into  
debt you are way ahead of most people but after 
knowing that how does it make you feel any better  
probably not loss aversion and that's where the 
fourth rule comes in and that is to use the lens  
of an individual rather than Society there is a 
quote that is if you change the way you look at  
things the things you look at change as I was 
doing the research for this video and drawing  
back on my own experiences a Common Thread became 
really clear to me in all of this and that is our  
perception of how well we're doing is massively 
driven by society's expectations and comparisons  
massively without a doubt Society applauds lavish 
Lifestyles external rankings monetary achievements  
but if we rewire our thoughts to look at our own 
Success Through The Eyes of us as an individual  
as opposed to Through The Eyes of society we 
can see ourselves from a completely different  
lens and when you do this it sets you free from 
comparison until gets you free from expectations  
it gives you the freedom from not having to play 
the game where other people are making the rules  
status games entirely he says you should think 
about how you'd answer this question would you  
rather be the world's greatest lover but have 
everyone think that you're the world's worst  
lover or would you rather be the world's worst 
lover but everyone else think that you're the  
world's best in other words would you rather be at 
the top of your ladder socially even if you're not  
and you're a complete fraud or would you be at the 
bottom of your ladder socially knowing deep down  
yourself that your number one so those are the 
four fundamentals that tend to dictate whether  
or not we're doing financially and how on track 
or off track they are thank you for watching if  
you like this video feel free to share it with 
someone who might be feeling financially behind  
but needs a little bit of reminder that they are 
actually on track I hope to see you next week"
JQZzkM4gr8w,"hi everyone welcome back in this video I'm 
going to share with you nine things that I  
stopped buying to make more money I don't believe 
in hoarding your money and doing nothing with it  
but I do believe in finding ways to live below 
your means so you can use that extra money to  
invest and to let that money grow for you cutting 
these nine things has left me with so much more  
money left over every month and I enjoy the same 
quality of life for way less let's get into it  
number one is trending or celebrity endorsed 
products there was a time when I spent a lot  
of money trying out and experimenting with 
different things whether it was for my hair  
for my skin I held this belief that the more 
products I've tried the higher my chances of  
finding something that actually worked would be 
for this thinking just led me to a waste a lot  
of money and B on things that never delivered 
any results so now rather than spending a lot  
of money on trying out a lot of different things 
and seeing what sticks I pay a bit more upfront  
on something if I know it means it's going to work 
and that's a lot more cost effective in the long  
run so for instance for my skin and I paid for 1 
one of consultation with a dermatologist to see  
what my skin needed and then today two years on 
I'm still using the only two products that were  
recommended which in total cost me the equivalent 
of forty dollars and that's it I don't feel the  
need to keep exploring and buying new things to 
see if something else is going to work as long  
as the person or the professional you're getting 
advice from doesn't have any money incentives to  
push certain products on you I found that this has 
been way more cost effective in the long run the  
second thing is buying in bulk purchases research 
shows that we are much more likely to do things  
with no involvement from us in doing that thing is 
necessary using that same thinking when it comes  
to buying in bulk or buying in packages you're far 
more likely to use something up when you know it's  
just sitting there in your cupboard I used to buy 
stuff as packages all the time extra face masks  
extra food items but now I have a strict buy as I 
need strategy this has made me much more mindful  
about why I actually need versus what I'm just 
using because it's there and it also means I'm not  
just stuck with the time not the same stuff and 
I have the freedom to try new things out and to  
experiment if I change my mind the third thing is 
transportation the three biggest costs for people  
are housing transportation and food and so if 
you're cutting back on spending and finding ways  
where you can have more left over every month this 
is a really key one since I sold my car I have so  
much more left over because I'm saving not only on 
the lease or the finance or the ongoing payments  
it's also the money that I'm saving on fuel and 
maintenance insurance and all the other hidden  
costs that go into car ownership I get the public 
transport everywhere and when I do need a car I'll  
just get an Uber and the price of that the amount 
of times I get an Uber within a month is way less  
than the cost of car ownership this doesn't work 
for everyone I don't have kids I don't need to  
drive to work but it means I can use the money 
that I'm saving to invest and let it grow so that  
I could buy a car when I need to when it becomes 
a priority next is home decor every time I saw  
something nice for my flat whether it was when I 
was at someone else's house and I saw something  
that I or whether I was out shopping I would buy 
that thing straight away jewelry stands lots of  
photograph frames different trays mugs but I found 
that this just cluttered up both my physical space  
and my mental space it meant that there was more 
to tidy up more to clean more to update and change  
so now I buy a few statement pieces you've already 
seen my home office tour the same also goes for my  
living room and for my bedroom other than the main 
items that I really need or want like a coffee  
table so far dining table and chairs I don't 
really keep anything else and I feel like the  
benefits of this go Way Beyond just saving money 
then we have overpriced branded clothing this was  
something I didn't fully grasp until my late 20s 
a good chunk of every paycheck for me used to go  
on costly designer stuff that a didn't increase 
in value and B wasn't even worth the price tag  
to start with I bought them mainly for the brand 
name which now looking back completely the wrong  
reason and the way I see this now when you you 
wear something with a massive logo or a brand  
symbol for example a top that has like Prada 
written across it it's like you're advertising  
their products but the catch is that they haven't 
paid you to promote it you've paid them to wear it  
I'm not saying all designer purchases are wrong if 
you're buying a designer item because you really  
like its Unique Style or the design or it's a 
long lasting quality then that's one thing but  
buy and get purely to show wealth or as a status 
signal for me that's a huge money drain and when  
you stop carrying just about showing people that 
you're rich you end up having a lot more money in  
your bank account next is the 48 hour rule I've 
started applying a 48 hour rule and this really  
is as straightforward as it sounds and you'll 
be surprised at how much money you save when  
you apply this according to a 2018 survey five out 
of six Americans have admitted to making impulsive  
purchases and it's easier than ever with the rise 
on online shopping and one click buy so now if I  
see something that I like before I go to put it 
into my shopping cart and check out pause and  
wait 48 hours before buying that thing after that 
48 hour period passes if I'm still thinking about  
it I'll go ahead and buy it but if I'm not it was 
just an impulsive buy and I've dodged unnecessary  
spending next we have books whilst I love reading 
my approach to buying books has become a lot more  
selective I'll first consume most books through 
a summary app and then if I like the book and I  
like the summary I'll go ahead and buy the full 
thing and read it but if I don't like it then I'm  
not wasting money on buying it this way I could 
try out so many more books and more genres that I  
wouldn't have tried out before without committing 
to paying for that thing the summary app I use is  
short form who are very kindly sponsoring this 
video one of the best things about short form is  
not only that they provide detailed book summaries 
they've also just launched a brand new browser  
extension which creates high quality summaries for 
articles blogs emails even for YouTube videos so

have hypothetical event clothing stats show that 
people only wear about 20 to 30 percent of the  
clothes in their wardrobe and this isn't even that 
surprising to me I used to constantly buy outfits  
for hypothetical events those oh this will be 
perfect for my friend's dinner party or I'll wear  
this for the next holiday I go on kind of clothes 
and these clothes they just ended up sitting in my  
wardrobe maybe I'd wear them once but for most 
of them the tags were attached still months or  
years later either the event never happened or by 
the time it did my fashion sets had changed now I  
buy a lot of Timeless pieces that I know will go 
with most things and won't go out of fashion and  
secondly I won't buy hypothetical event clothing 
anymore if I need something that our buyer and  
wear it immediately if it's for a future event 
I'll buy it if I need it the next one is something  
I stopped doing a while ago it was in my last 
things I stopped buying video and it seemed  
to be the thing that surprised the most people 
and that is high maintenance treatments I pretty  
much never spend money on getting my nails or my 
hair or my eyelashes done anymore even more than  
saving money I find it incredibly time consuming 
and I personally just can't sit still for an hour  
or two and do nothing I know for some people they 
see it as pampering and self-care but for me it's  
the opposite and I way rather use that money on 
something else that has a return on investment  
with my hair I never diet because of all the 
maintenance and the hassle that comes with me so I  
usually leave it natural other than for my YouTube 
videos I started using the Dyson air app so those  
are nine things that I cut out of my budget let 
me know if you agree with any of these and they  
resonate with you and you'll try it out or if you 
completely disagree with any of them thank you so  
much for watching don't forget to subscribe if you 
haven't already and if you like this video you may

money which I'll link over there see you there"
2szahwJwEfs,"this year I turned my passion into a six-figure 
business it wasn't easy nor was it an overnight  
process it was a result of trying and failing at 
a number of different things taking lessons from  
experts in the field and applying the learnings 
from the best books on business and marketing  
so in this video I want to share with you a 
three-part process that helped me turn something  
I love into a six-figure business and this video 
is split into three parts firstly how to turn your  
passion into something that people want secondly 
how to escape competition and thirdly how to make  
money from it I'll also cover my honest opinion on 
monetizing your passion and some of the doubtfuls  
that come with it if you want to dive deeper into 
any of these topics I have a detailed guide that  
goes into each of these steps in more detail and 
the first part of the guide is about how to figure  
out what skill set or hobby you have that is worth 
monetizing in the first place part one how to turn  
your passion into something that people want 
having just a strong passion for something is  
not enough there is another crucial element that 
you need to nail down to guarantee the success of  
your business venture and there's this quote that 
is you want to find something that feels like play  
to you but looks like work to others the feel 
like play to you part is something that you're  
naturally good at you enjoy and you don't mind 
spending extra hours on it after work because it  
makes you feel alive it makes you feel energized 
this is the passion part the other part is the  
it looks like work to others and it is equally 
important it means that in the eyes of society  
the thing that you love is seen as work to others 
and therefore is likely to have value you want  
the thing that you're passionate about to also be 
practical and for other people to think it's worth  
paying for it's not easy to intersect and balance 
the two but a good place to start according to  
Josh Kaufman in the book personal MBA is to think 
about what are the basic human needs although  
people appear to want many different things he 
argues that they in fact make purchases in an  
attempt to fulfill five basic needs and to take 
the practicality part of the equation we should  
think about how our passion falls into one or 
more of these the first deed is to feel good  
about ourselves we want to be healthy look good 
feel good and enjoy experiences the second need  
is connection so romantic relations professional 
connections friendships next we have learning and  
growth and this I would say is where my passion 
falls into the aim here is to help people learn  
something new and develop as individuals the 
fourth need is safety both for us and our  
belongings and lastly the need to avoid effort so 
this means getting rid of tasks that take up too  
much time and energy the key is to identify which 
of these needs your business idea can fulfill and  
that is essentially the practicality part of the 
equation if you're struggling to find how your  
passion can fall into one of these think about 
whether there is someone else in the world that is  
making money from your skill or your passion and 
how they are going about it because it's likely  
that they are reframing what they do to fall into 
one of these five step two promote yourself you  
may be really good at what you do in fact one 
of the best in the field at air but that doesn't  
matter if if no one knows about what you can do so 
the next step is to get as good as you can at your  
craft whilst providing free information as proof 
of your value and your knowledge so depending  
on what you could do this can be through blog 
posts tutorials webinars podcasts social media  
posts workshops or any other platform where your 
potential customers are likely to be by providing  
this information for free firstly you're getting 
better at it day in day out and secondly you're  
showcasing your skills and you're building trust 
with people along the way so simply put when you  
give away valuable information for free you're 
letting potential customers try out your services  
without spending any money it's like a free trial 
for them this lets them see how good your work is  
and how helpful you could be and if you keep 
giving them helpful information that they like  
and they're benefiting from they're more likely 
to buy something that you're selling for example a  
personal fitness trainer might offer free workout 
plans or nutrition tips on a blog or social media  
and if a potential customer tries these plans and 
it feels like it's working for them they're more  
likely to consider hiring that trainer or using 
their services then another trainer that doesn't  
offer any free value and everything that they 
have is only behind a paid wall the other thing  
to consider here is okay if everyone is providing 
free information how do I stand out what makes  
me any different and I truly believe that the 
most important way to escape competition is to  
build a business and to build a brand that is an 
extension of yourself in a world where everything  
is so readily available you need to be able to add 
your personality into the mix and there are two  
ways mainly that you can do this the first is to 
bring your unique perspective no two people will  
interpret and present information in the exact 
same way we all have our own experiences our own  
expertise that we bring to the information that we 
share so your perspective can provide a new take  
on very familiar topics it can offer new insights 
new connections or new ways to use the information  
so your unique perspective might be just what 
someone else needs to understand a concept that  
they've had trouble understanding Landing ever 
before the second thing is your presentation not  
only is your point of view important but also 
how that information is presented although some  
people say what I'm doing is nothing new and a 
lot of this information is available online I  
know that I had trouble finding someone who I can 
connect with when it comes to discussing money or  
has similar values or beliefs like me so I was 
sure that many others had also faced the same  
problem the person telling the story is sometimes 
just as important as the story itself and we tend  
to be attracted to people who can explain things 
in a way that matches how we understand and we  
learn so don't underestimate the importance of 
you telling a story or telling a point that is  
already covered by other people there are going 
to be lots of different things that you'll need  
to learn when monetizing a passion and I found a 
free and easy way to learn these essential skills  
through today's sponsor brilliant.org who are 
very kindly sponsoring this video brilliant.org  
is an amazing online platform with thousands 
of interactive bite-sized lessons where you  
can Master complicated topics like artificial 
intelligence crypto search data analysis and you

a day and gradually Master each topic they have  
interactive lessons and quizzes to keep even 
the most dull and the most complicated topics  
interesting and I'm particularly loving their new 
course on thinking and code some form of coding  
is used in pretty much everything when it comes to 
building a brand creating websites email campaigns  
newsletters and it's really helped me grasp the 
concepts so whether you're a professional who's  
looking to prepare for quantitative interviews 
and skill sets to learn a high paying job or  
you want to learn some basic skills to start 
a side hustle there will be a course in here

you do like it by using that link you also get

marketing and sales the hardest part in this  
process I would say is Finding Your Passion that 
you can monetize in the first place and the second  
hardest is the marketing and sales it's easy to 
give away information for free but when you start  
making money or charging for it you might feel 
uncomfortable and this could be for a number of  
reasons because of fear of rejection and feeling 
like you're bragging or just feeling bad about  
charging but the reality is that if you don't make 
money from your passion or your hobby it stops at  
that it's not a business and you're very likely 
not going to be able to put in all the time and  
the resources to make it into something big and 
to make it into something that more people have  
access to if you're passionate about what you 
do and believe your product or service can help  
people then don't be afraid to charge for it 
and I heard someone say by not charging you're  
keeping people from benefiting from what you have 
to offer and it's a great way to reframe the way  
you think about charging people for your services 
and this doesn't always mean having to charge the  
customer but also being a bit creative and seeing 
where else you can make money so again with this  
YouTube channel which is one of the streams that 
I'm making money through this passion although  
you're not paying to watch this content I am able 
to make money through AdSense through affiliate  
links through sponsors one thing I do want to say 
if and when you turn your passion into a business  
is that a lot of the fun diminishes when you 
think about out the bunny side of it before my  
channel got monetized I absolutely loved creating 
content when I had a minute to spare on the train  
or whilst I was walking I would be thinking of 
new ideas and or bring me so much joy it was  
almost like an escape from my day job and then 
the first month that my channel got monetized it  
was the best feeling because my work was being 
rewarded but since then the joy of creating  
content hasn't been on the same level as it has 
pre-making money from it because you have this  
new expectation from it and so what I've recently 
started to do is shift my focus back on the impact  
rather than the monetization I have this document 
where every time I read a message or an email or  
I see a comment on my Channel or anywhere else 
I'll take a screenshot and I'll put it into this  
document and then whenever I feel like I don't 
want to create content I don't want to get up and  
create a video but read that document and it'll 
give me a burst on motivation and I realize that  
the importance to keep the initial excitement 
and the joy is to measure your success with  
things that aren't monetary for example asking 
yourself questions like how is my work connecting  
with people how is is it causing people to live a 
different life or motivating them to make a small  
change in their lives at least when I'm focusing 
on that everything else just comes as a byproduct  
so that's my formula and my tips and advice for 
turning your hobby into a passion or a business  
I'd love to hear if that sparked any ideas or 
interest in you and I really would recommend  
to the free guide that I have it goes into a lot 
more detail into each of these topics as well and  
other things that you want to consider if you do 
like this video you may also enjoy another video  
that I have on side hustles you can start I'll 
link that over here and I hope to see you there"
2SzEDY8qnBs,"have you ever taken a step back and looked at 
your life and thought I am so far away from  
where I want to be well that's exactly where 
I found myself two years ago and I reckon the  
majority of people feel this way whether it's 
now or at some point in their lives we all get  
to a point of feeling like we want to do more we 
want to find our passion we want to do something  
that we love but we don't know where to start 
or how to go about it so in this video I want  
to show you the process that I went through to 
essentially brainwash myself for success to let  
go of any negative beliefs and how I created 
a plan that I knew would work I'm aware that  
there are going to be things in this video that 
are controversial and that some people may not  
agree with but if I chose to hide them just so 
that I don't offend anyone then you're not going  
to get the full truth I have a template that 
I use for this whole process so the questions  
that I ask myself the brainstorming I did it goes 
Way Beyond what I could fit in this video and so  
if you really want to take this as seriously as I 
did then you can use the same template which I've  
included in the link below is completely free step 
one choose design design the majority of us live  
a life that is set by default and we don't think 
twice about it because it's the norm because it's  
comfortable and often we don't even realize that 
we haven't designed the path that we're on until  
we actually take a step back and question whether 
we want the thing at the top the issue with going  
down this default route is that firstly which 
is the worst case scenario you get to the top  
and only once you're at the top do you realize 
that this isn't what you wanted and you wasted  
all your years in a climb that wasn't yours the 
second scenario is that you start climbing that  
ladder and you get a fair bit maybe halfway and 
you look at other people who are already at the  
top and you realize that you don't actually want 
what they have at that point it becomes a little  
bit easier to climb back down and then get on the 
right ladder but the issue is that most people  
will just keep climbing on the existing one to 
avoid any pain and there is a snippet from a video  
with Oprah Winfrey that I'll play here people get 
to where they want to go because they know where  
they want to go oh wow most people don't know 
where they want to go a lot of people are going  
and being driven by what they think they should 
do right what other people say they should do what  
they have carried in their mind for a long time 
they should do but the most important question you  
can ever ask yourself is what do I really want 
wow the goal here is to look at what's at the  
top and ask yourself is this worth climbing will I 
feel fulfilled will I be living a life that I want  
to both enduring and when I get to the top some of 
the questions that I asked myself when I was doing  
this exercise was what would I want to experience 
in life if time and money were not an issue what  
does a successful life look like to me where am I 
going and how do I want to be remembered when I'm  
gone I've included all the questions I answered 
in the free template with example answers this  
will help you get really clear on what you 
want and how close you are to your version  
of a successful life or how far away you are from 
it for me it was the latter it was how far away I  
was and believe me there is no better motivation 
than realizing if you don't take action your life  
will look the same 10 years from now step two 
bridge the gap there is a two-step process to  
this part and the second part is probably a part 
that might be a bit controversial the first part  
is your strategy which boils down to three areas 
your skills your habits and people this is all  
about assessing where you are now and how you are 
going to make the changes to get closer to where  
you want to be firstly what skills do you want to 
master to achieve your goals think about what you  
need to do and how and whom you can learn from for 
example when I decided that I want to take YouTube  
seriously I knew that I didn't have the skills 
to make it work I was fully aware of that I also  
didn't have access to anyone who had done what I 
wanted to do but what I did know is that all the  
information that I needed to succeed was available 
and all the skills that I wanted could be learned  
through YouTube videos through books through 
podcasts the second part is habits what habits  
do you want to unlearn and new habits do you want 
to master and then finally people who are you  
surrounded by think about the people who influence 
you in a negative way and then think about the  
positive people that you want to spend more time 
with when thinking about the negative people in  
your life be really conscious of the way you feel 
when you speak to certain people or how they make  
you feel do they make you feel like you're aiming 
for too much do they make you think too much do  
they drain your energy do they gossip all the time 
I made an active effort to remove all of that from  
my life and I'll go into this point a bit more in 
the third section the second part of this step is  
to have this unwavering disproportionate belief 
that you're going to achieve that thing and give  
yourself a predetermined period of time where you 
will become obsessed with it you'll think about  
it first thing in the morning you'll dream about 
it you think about it lasting at night and there  
is this quote that is use the weekend to build the 
life that you want instead of trying to escape the  
life that you have you want to dedicate every free 
moment you have to this thing that's going to mean  
saying no to social plans saying no to things that 
you want to do saying no to spending your money on  
some things because you need that money to invest 
in yourself and to grow there are only so many  
hours in a day and we all have commitments that 
are unavoidable like a full-time job children so  
with the Limited hours we do have you need to 
commit them to the life that you're designing  
I'm going to be honest it's not going to be 
the easiest period of your life but the best  
of Life comes from making the decisions to do 
something difficult now to enjoy the rewards of  
the compounding later most things that feel good 
now will feel bad later and most things that feel  
hard now will feel good later step three along 
the way when you're on a different path creating a  
life that isn't the default it is inevitable that 
you're going to face obstacles both personally and  
professionally so two things you want to remember 
when you're on this path the first is to take  
advice from the right people you will get so many 
opinions and a lot of people may throw you off  
track for different reasons and they it may not 
be because of any bad intentions but their beliefs  
aren't the same as yours don't waste your energy 
trying to fight it to tell them that they're wrong  
or to try and explain what you're doing not 
worth it the only people who you want to get  
advice from are people who are already where you 
want to be or have done something similar if they  
don't have either of those two there is no point 
listing or letting the opinions of others dictate  
your path the second is cut off the drainers but 
don't isolate yourself you're going to grow apart  
from people along the way for different reasons 
you change they change likely you won't be there  
to hang out with them all the time I still have 
moments where for a period of time no one will  
hear from me I'll just disappear and then I'll 
come back and be ready to socialize again and  
then I'll disappear again and work really hard on 
whatever I'm doing and not everyone will get that  
not everyone will understand what you're trying to 
do and it can be lonely but the people who do get  
it will stand by you have a few people that you 
really trust that are really happy for you whether  
it's one person two people three people just have 
them around you so that is the process that I went  
through and through this journey of Discovery I 
have read more books in the past two years than  
I have probably in the rest of my life combined 
and it has been such an important part of my  
process which is why I wanted to talk about short 
form because it's one of the ways I was able to  
consume everything that I did short form is a web 
app for reading book summaries you could use it  
on your laptop you could use it on your phone and 
it is hands down the best book summary app that I  
have found I've tried several including blinkist 
but I found that there but summaries were a bit  
superficial whereas some reason short form are 
very in-depth so you get a one-pager summary but  
you also get detailed chapter summaries and what 
I really like about it is that where they give  
you a summary of a book they don't just provide a 
summary of a book they also include Snippets where  
they bring in learnings and insights from other 
books for example after a certain section they  
might say although this author talks about this 
it is controversial because this evidence shows  
otherwise and they then give you a link to a book 
summary or a Blog that they provide additional  
points to consider it's so much more than just a 
book summary and I get so much value from reading  
a short form summary that I would any other 
platform that I have found so I reached out to  
them and asked if they could sponsor a video and 
they agreed so thank you short form for sponsoring  
this video if you want to check it out can get 
a free trial by using the link in my bio short  
form.com forward slash Nisha and you could also 
get 20 off your subscription through that link as  
well so I hope you enjoy this video and I really 
hope you do the exercises with this video and it  
helps you find your path whatever that path may 
be thank you for watching and see you next week"

hi everyone welcome back in this video I'm 
going to take you around my productivity  
setup I truly believe that spending your money on 
your productivity setup is one of the best return  
on investments you can make all of my income 
streams essentially operate from my desk and  
so for me this space has become a place that I 
love where I feel motivated productive and it  
just makes my working day so much more enjoyable 
a bit of a disclaimer this isn't a video with all  
the latest tech and gadgets so if you're after 
that then there are better videos to watch but  
if you're looking for ideas to help turn your 
workspace into a place that energizes you and  
helps you produce your best work then I will show 
you how I do it most of the links I mention are  
in the description box below starting with the 
essentials first up we have this desk from Ikea  
which I bought for 179 pounds I bought it during 
lockdown as a quick fix but three years on it's  
still going strong and I don't plan on changing 
it anytime soon especially if given that this was  
assembled by yours truly so I definitely have 
an attachment to it it also has a Shelf at the  
back where I can hide all my masks cables plugs 
so even if I had the desk facing the other way  
which I did for a while still looks really tidy 
you can build your storage cupboards to the left  
or to the right I have them to the right and it 
has one drawer and an opening cupboard then inside  
I have these little organizers that I got from 
Amazon and you can move them around and put them  
in whatever configuration you want you could buy 
different sizes colors so instead of just shoving  
everything into one drawer and not being able 
to find anything this is a really great way of  
keeping everything organized so onto my desk map 
this is Amazon 15 pounds waterproof dual color it  
just gives it a bit of oomph the laptop I use 
is my trusty Macbook Pro 13 inch I don't use a  
monitor I'm usually working from different places 
so I'm very used to working on a smaller screen  
and I am an Apple MacBook life I wouldn't be able 
to use anything else the downside however with the  
new Macbook Pros is that they don't have a USB 
port so I use this USBC adapter to plug things  
in then I have this beautiful laptop Riser from 
grovemade I actually got gifted this one but I  
really liked their stuff it has such a unique 
finish that I went back and bought some more  
items from there the items almost make my entire 
setup and the quality is very very good so when  
I make an updated productivity workspace video in 
30 years time don't be surprised if this makes an  
appearance I went for the laptop stand because I 
feel like it suits the room better it's angled I  
could tuck things underneath but I was choosing 
between this and their desk shelf and that is  
actually their best seller could be used for both 
laptops and monitors and if you want to check it  
out I've got an affiliate Link in the description 
and then I also have this matching keyboard tray  
to finish off the set and it adds to My overall 
workflow or so I tell myself the keyboard I use is  
this Logitech MX keys I tried the Apple keyboard 
it's not for me I want my keyboard to make a bit  
of a sound when I'm typing away but I don't want 
it to be too loud so this is perfect it also has  
these three buttons that lets you switch between 
the devices that you're connected to I've paired  
up with this Logitech 2s wireless mouse but if you 
have the extra money to spend have a look at the  
Logitech Master Three Mouse instead everyone Raves 
about it and I'm most likely going to upgrade to  
that soon next we have the song mix desk chair 
in mesh black you can move the armrest high up  
and down you can lift the chair seat up and down 
there's padded cushions ergonomic curve kind of  
all the things you want in a chair I spent far too 
many years working from a dining chair never again  
because lower back issues aren't a joke and to top 
it off I've have this carpet protector chair mat  
so I can swivel around as much as I want without 
leaving any dents in the carpet okay now moving on  
to my desk accessories I don't keep watching my 
desk I like it being very uncluttered but there  
are a few key items that I have one being this 
wireless speaker it's light the charge lasts  
forever and a day and it's fully worth the price 
and I'm in full productivity mode I'll connect it  
to my deep focus playlist on Spotify and then for 
any other day it's Taylor Swift and then we have  
this because I can't do a tour of my productivity 
setup without incorporating fuel so I've been a  
pain customer full for over two years now and 
I have it pretty regularly I have a dedicated  
space in my cupboard for all of my fuel products 
and I've tried almost all of the range now and  
the two that I've been having them most recently 
are they're ready to drink and their heel black  
edition which I've just tried recently and it is 
in my opinion the tastiest product they have this  
is what I have now almost every morning I put 
500 milliliters of water I add two scoops and  
then shake it for 10 seconds it turns into this 
smoothie that contains 26 vitamins and minerals  
it's plant-based which is even more of a win 
because I'm a vegetarian and it includes 40 grams  
of protein my personal favorite is their chocolate 
flavored one if I don't have time to have a proper  
lunch then this has been such a lifesaver if you 
want to try out this product the link in the video  
description will get you two free products along 
with that firstly a free heel t-shirt which I wear  
mine all the time and then secondly a Shaker with 
this you have a nutritionally complete meal that  
is ready to go the next thing I keep on my desk 
is this wax melt scented candle these little wax  
bars melt as you put your tea light underneath 
and it lasts hours and hours and makes me feel  
all Zen then I have this notepad I keep it on my 
desk at all times it doesn't look cluttered or  
ruined the aesthetic feel and I also have this pen 
and pen holder that goes with it as you can see I  
don't like cluttering my workspace with loads 
of stationery so I just keep this one pen and  
this one pen holder on my desk and my friend got 
me this coaster when she asked me to be her maid  
of honor it just reminds me that I'm loved every 
now and then and finally on to the other key items  
in my workspace a plant in the office space is 
a must this is the kentia plant pretty easy to  
look after has died on me a couple of times but 
I've brought it back to life it's usually a bit  
Fuller but it's getting there and I also have 
this plant over here which gives my otherwise  
gray black room a pop of color moving on to my 
Ikea bookshelf so on the Shelf I have my favorite  
all-time books and hard copy and they are held 
together by these little men very sturdy looks  
really cool and both of them together were less 
than 20 pounds I also have this stressful which  
comes in handy whenever someone does my head 
in I resume cool and I have to stay composed  
and I have loads of little storage things here 
as well around my home this one is my memories  
box this is for important documents and this one 
just has a load of junk in there and then three  
more things that add to my productivity first this 
whiteboard there is something incredibly motivated  
eating when you see your non-negotiable task for 
the day and for the week written here every week  
and when you know you have to tick them off 
you get them done so I highly recommend this  
this one is from Amazon 30 pounds comes with 
the rubber comes with the pens and then if you  
want to take things seriously you can also get 
the cleaning spray which comes separately the  
second thing is this side desk I have two I keep 
one in my living room next to my armchair and the  
other one in this office room whenever I want a 
nap but I know I need to work and be productive  
then working from this armchair is a good middle 
ground it's a good compromise and then one of my  
favorites this 360 S8 a robot vacuum cleaner with 
mob this thing godsend we haven't hoovered or what  
in the last six months it vacuums every part of 
your floor every little corner that you don't  
think it could reach it could get in there and 
then on the areas where I have wooden flooring  
it also goes over it with a mop that is my 
productivity setup let me know if there's  
anything else that you've used that you recommend 
I spend my money on thanks and see you next week"
wa0btZay9gU,"well this isn't a video that I ever planned on 
making but here we are so in this video I'm going  
to share with you exactly what my salary was 
every year for the last nine years in banking  
to clarify I don't think it's easy for anyone 
to come onto a public platform and say how much  
money they've made especially not the British we 
don't do this stuff and I haven't seen anyone do  
it but hopefully it can encourage others to have 
these conversations and to do the same and to  
break down some of the barriers that exist when it 
comes to discussing pay because by not having this  
information accessible it works against us and 
you'll see what I mean as we go through this video  
I'm going to share my numbers using Great British 
pounds as I get paid in pounds but given that US  
dollar is the most globally traded currency and a 
lot of my audience is outside of the UK also going  
to include the US dollar equivalent on the screen 
so quickly over the land when it comes to banking  
what most people don't realize is that there 
are so many different areas within a bank that  
pay completely differently but broadly speaking 
you can categorize about Bank within three areas  
the front office the middle office and the back 
office and without boring you with the intricacies  
typically those working in the front office earn 
the most as they are Revenue generating meaning  
they make the bank money then the back office 
particularly technology is probably the next best  
paid and then it's middle office if you want to 
know a bit more about the functions and how they  
work then I have a specific video which I'll link 
up here but for now we're just focusing on the  
money side of things so I started my career 
working in the middle office of one of the  
world's largest investment Banks I did a summer 
internship program there in 2012 and was paid 7  
500 pounds for 10 weeks so if you prorator that on 
a monthly basis it's around 3225 pounds a month I  
didn't pay any tax on that amount because I was a 
full-time student at the time and it was under the  
taxable threshold then that internship turned 
into a full-time offer at the same bank still  
in Middle office so after graduating as a first 
year analyst my starting salary in 2013 was 35  
000 pounds which after tax and state contributions 
National Insurance was 2218 pounds per month so  
that's what I'm going to say for each of these 
numbers I'm going to give you the pre-tax gross  
salary on an annualized basis and then the amount 
that was left in my bank account after taking away  
taxes and state contributions the amount that 
hit the bank account each month so again this 35  
000 was the lowest starting salary on the graduate 
program with the front office and the back office  
functions making almost 10 to 20 more then as 
a second year unless I got a seven percent pay  
rise so my salary went up to 37 500 for the 
year and after tax and other contributions  
it was 2 371 pounds per month that hit my bank 
account that meant with a seven percent pay rise  
I had an additional 153 pounds each month in my 
third year of working within the bank I moved to  
the front office specifically in an area called 
transaction banking I thought at that time that  
that would mean I get a huge pay rise but the 
reality was very very different and my salary  
went up six percent to 40 000 pounds per year 
on a monthly basis after taxes that was three  
thousand five hundred and twenty three pounds per 
month so although I moved to the front office I  
didn't get the paywise that I was hoping for and 
at the time I was told it's because I moved within  
the same bank and because of that it would take 
me a few years to catch up with my peers in the  
division and what they get paid my younger self 
believed this until a year later someone else I  
knew made the exact same move from back office 
to a front office the same function and they  
got a substantial pay rise and that's when I 
learned the importance of firstly talking to  
others about money and of what they're making and 
secondly not just taking the first thing that you  
get thinking it's the best offer that can come 
through okay moving on to the next year I got  
promoted to a first year associate and given this 
new information that I had it was the first time  
that I negotiated my salary so that year my pay 
was adjusted and I got a 30 pay rise so my salary  
went up to 52 000 pounds a year again after taxes 
and other contributions that was 3 135 pounds  
in my bank account each month then the following 
year as a second year associate so same division  
same team one more year of experience my salary 
stayed flat it didn't increase at all not even in  
line with inflation so I made again 52 000 pounds 
that year and after tax per month it was slightly  
higher it was 3161 pounds and that's because the 
personal allowance tax bracket changed that year  
so it meant that I got more on a monthly basis now 
here's where it gets interesting had I stayed in  
the same organization and having spoken to people 
who are still in that same organization still in  
the same division still in the same team my salary 
wouldn't be looking a huge amount different today  
four or five years later maybe it would have 
increased 15 to 20 percent maximum but as I've  
said a number of times on this channel if you 
don't think you're getting paid what you're worth  
and you also don't see any career progression or 
opportunities worth staying for then move and find  
somewhere that will pay you what you're worth and 
that's what I did I applied to other places and I  
got an offer at a second tier Investment Bank so 
not one of the largest anymore not as well known  
it was about a quarter of the size a similar skill 
set required different division but still in the  
front office and I got a 45 pay rise so my annual 
salary was now 75 000 pounds and after tax and  
other contributions it was 4 297 pounds per month 
I would never have seen that paywise had I stayed  
in the same organization then the first year that 
I was in this new bank I got promoted to a first  
year vice president and I got another pay rise 
and this time it was 20 so my salary went up to 90  
000 pounds for the year which after tax after 
ni was 5061 pounds per month then as a second  
year vice president I still got another pay rise 
a smaller pay rise but greater than the rate of  
inflation at the time and it was seven percent 
so my base salary was now 96 000 pounds on an  
annualized basis which on a monthly basis after 
tax and ni was five thousand three 359 pounds so  
this was last year and just to give you an idea 
of my savings rate my expenses were 2 500 pounds  
a month and I've got a video which breaks down 
exactly how that money was spent what my mortgage  
is my interest rate I have all of that in a video 
that I'll also link up my whole financial life is  
online and then in December last year I started 
a new job at another bank for another number of  
reasons which I'll explain in another video and 
again doing something slightly different and I  
got another pay rise that I wouldn't have seen had 
I stayed within the same organization now there  
are a few things that I've missed intentionally 
because it differs so much that it wouldn't help  
you in any way so I haven't included my bonus 
in these numbers this is discretionary and it  
is heavily reliant on your performance and the 
economy and it can range from zero to over a  
hundred percent of your base salary typically 
those in the front office will see a bigger  
percentage of their base salary as a bonus and the 
same goes as you climb up the corporate ladder the  
more senior you are you can broadly expect 
a higher percentage of your base salary as a  
bonus so when I started in Middle office my bonus 
was at best 15 of my base salary and then when I  
moved to the front office that percentage was a 
lot higher the second thing I haven't mentioned  
is pension contribution and depending on which 
bank you work for they offer different employer  
match systems the last one I worked for offered up 
to 10 of what I put in so that was in addition to  
my basic salary and in most years I completely 
maxed out so those are my numbers and I wanted  
to clarify that unlike most people on YouTube I'm 
not a cash millionaire and I think that there is  
this assumption that if you're in banking you're 
making millions but that really isn't the case  
for the majority of areas within a bank at least 
in London and banking doesn't pay what it used to  
pre the 2008 financial crisis there are other 
areas in the front office that get paid a lot  
more than the numbers you've seen here so mergers 
and Acquisitions trading and there are also other  
areas of the front office that get paid a lot less 
but I'm not going to go into the details of that  
and I can just give you the information that I 
know is true and that's reliable and those are my  
numbers a couple of things that I've learned in 
the last nine years of working in the corporate  
life firstly don't be afraid to negotiate because 
you don't get paid your worth you get paid your  
ability to negotiate and that's just part of life 
negotiations it's such an important skill and if  
you keep passing up the opportunity to do it the 
gap between you and someone else who is doing it  
is only only going to get wider and wider as 
the years go by the second thing is be okay to  
move the biggest jumps in salary came from when I 
switched jobs I'm not saying that you always need  
to just jump around at every opportunity but when 
the time comes when you feel like you're really  
fighting hard to get a pay rise and you're putting 
in 100 and you're not getting paid your worth and  
nothing else is working for you in that role 
don't be afraid to leave and go somewhere else  
you're more likely to get paid your worth that 
way than by staying in the same place and just  
constantly fighting year and year out because yeah 
loyalty is great but only when it's rewarded and  
finally maximize other forms of compensation 
so in addition to base salary there are other  
forms of compensation bonuses benefits pension 
contributions annual leave and so understand them  
and don't be afraid to maximize these as well 
because they can improve your overall package  
anyway I would never have done this in a parallel 
world but I said from the start that I want to be  
completely transparent on this channel no matter 
how hard it is I found it incredibly helpful  
whenever I've come across similar content 
although mostly from creators in different  
Industries because it gives me an idea of what 
other Industries are paying and where I can  
expect the biggest page arms and what is possible 
but I'd also love to hear from you whether this  
has helped you at all or whether you rather I 
avoid videos like this in the future and I'll  
take that feedback on as I shape the direction 
of where my channel goes thank you for watching  
if you enjoyed this video you will also enjoy 
another video that I have on my expect expenses  
that I mentioned and how they are allocated 
and I'll link that over here and see you there"
m3RDwsj1Sms,"transportation is one of the most significant 
wealth trainers and with the average person  
spending 15 to 20 percent of their annual income 
on it it falls into one of the top three expenses  
in our daily life and as both new and second-hand 
car prices are surging an important question to  
consider is what is the most efficient way to buy 
a car and what guidelines can we follow to make  
sure we're not paying more than we can afford 
so in this video I thought it'd be interesting  
to go through the main rules or guidelines when 
it comes to buying a car and how much you should  
spend depending on your salary I will also go over 
my personal approach and how I'm going about it  
before I get into it if you're new here I'm Nisha 
and this is part of an account and explain Series  
where we discuss all things personal finance 
and Building Wealth let's get into it the first  
guideline is the 25 to 35 approach this method is 
all about balancing your love for cars if you have  
one with your other financial needs if you're more 
of the Frugal type or perhaps you're starting off  
on your car ownership Journey then according 
to this approach the lower end the 25 of your  
free tax annual salary so your gross income that 
should be your target for a car purchase on the  
other hand if buying a car sits high up in your 
priorities and you're willing to trim down on  
other expenses to accommodate this then you may be 
able to push that budget up to 35 of your annual  
income so that means for those earning 40 000 a 
year you can expect to spend between 10 000 and 14  
000 based on these guidelines on a new car if 
you're bringing in 60 000 a year then you're  
looking at a price tag ranging between fifteen 
thousand and twenty one thousand and if you're  
on a salary of a hundred thousand a year then the 
sweet spot for a new car purchase lies between  
twenty five thousand and thirty five thousand 
using these rules this isn't a hard and fast rule  
but it's a guideline to keep you from overdoing 
it if you've got other Financial commitments or  
you'd prefer to allocate your funds towards other 
life Pleasures you want to aim towards the lower  
end of that and that's what I would recommend if 
you're going for this approach the next guideline  
you can consider is the 24 10 approach which is 
a very simple yet very effective strategy when  
making a wise car purchase the 20 stands for the 
down payment you should be making on your car so  
let's say you're eyeing up a 30 000 car that means 
six thousand of that should be your down payment  
if you're not able to afford six thousand then 
you want to look for a car that is cheaper below  
that bracket and so one that you can afford to put 
down 20 of the car price for the four represents  
the term of the car loan so simply put you should 
aim to pay off your car loan in no more than four  
years I.E 48 months this helps to reduce the 
amount of Interest you'll pay over the term of  
the loan and it'll also help you make sure you 
don't end up underwater on your loan I.E owning  
more on your car than it's worth and then finally 
the 10 is the portion of your total monthly income  
that should be allocated to car expenses so this 
includes not only your monthly car payment but  
also things like your maintenance and your 
insurance so let's plug in some numbers say  
you earn sixty thousand dollars a year or roughly 
five thousand a month following the 2410 approach  
your car related expenses shouldn't go over 500 
a month so to illustrate how this works let's  
consider two scenarios one common approach that a 
lot of people do and one that strictly follows the  
2410 approach so scenario one let's say you find 
a car that you love priced at twenty five thousand  
you don't make a down payment so you finance the 
entire amount your loan has an interest rate I'm  
assuming of just under eight percent but instead 
of sticking to a four year Term Loan you decide  
to stretch out to a five-year term loan I.E 16 
months this means your monthly car payment would  
be just over 500 a month bringing in the total 
cost of the car the amount you're paying over  
the five years to over thirty thousand dollars 
and over five thousand dollars of that is paid on  
interest alone scenario two now let's say you're 
following the 24 10 rule you buy the same 25  
000 car and this time you make a 20 down payment 
so you put five thousand dollars down the interest  
right is the same so we can convert this side 
by side we're assuming eight percent interest  
rate but you decide to stick to a four-year Term 
Loan I.E 48 months your monthly payments will now  
actually be lower so it'll be 488 dollars a month 
but not only that the total cost that you pay in  
interest over the car loan instead of over five 
thousand four hundred dollars it's three thousand  
four hundred dollars that's almost two thousand 
dollars less so if we look at the total impact the  
total cost of the car using the 2410 rule is just 
under 28 500 compared to the over thirty thousand  
dollars if you weren't using this rule so that's 
a saving you would have and how it would work if  
you simply followed the 2410 ball or a variation 
of it that then leads me to the third strategy  
which is the cash approach cash approach one of 
the benefits of buying a car outright is that you  
completely eliminate the need for financing saving 
you from paying any interest whatsoever it sounds  
simple but depending on the car you're buying 
this approach requires a lot of money up front  
which can firstly consider terribly drain your 
savings or your emergency fund and secondly the  
reality for many people is that they don't just 
have twenty five thousand dollars sitting in their  
bank account ready to be spent on a car so there's 
a middle ground approach that still follows the  
principles of fiscal prudence and one alternative 
is to buy a second-hand car outright using what  
you would have spent on a down payment for a new 
car so referring back to the previous scenario  
this would mean spending five thousand dollars 
on a car outright yes the car you get for five  
thousand dollars might not be anything special 
or the latest model in anything but remember  
this is about understanding the trade-offs and the 
benefits of delayed gratification the second hand  
car approach looking at its potential benefits 
Over a four-year term which is the same time  
period we're looking at with the 2410 rule if you 
had been paying 488 dollars a month for a new car  
over four years that amounts to 28 000 in total 
that you would have paid instead if you used 5 000  
of that to buy a car outright and for the sake of 
complexity let's assume that the rest of the money  
that you would have paid towards your car payment 
you in fact saved then by the end of year four you  
would have saved up enough to potentially afford 
to buy a 23 000 car outright in cash after four  
years again eliminating the need for any financing 
so essentially by spending less now you have the  
potential to afford more in the future whilst 
also paying less in the form of interest and  
minimizing your exposure to debt and then finally 
let's go into what my take is on this and how I'm  
going about it so I'm going for the delayed 
gratification route and insulation so in some  
instances such as in my personal experience the 
best decision is opting for no car at all I found  
that not owning a car right now is the most cost 
effective route for me so I ran the numbers and  
found that getting a taxi or an Uber whenever I 
needed a car turned out to be more cost efficient  
than the cost associated with leasing with 
financing with buying a car right and the costs  
of fuel Insurance maintenance Etc so I'd rather 
spend that money from foregoing car ownership  
towards aspects of my my life that offer a greater 
value or positively impact my financial situation  
at this stage that means spending on convenience 
spending to Outsource tasks and reinvesting the  
funds in a way so that when the day comes that 
buying a car is a priority it doesn't take away  
from other things that I want to do as well 
when it comes to these numbers obviously like  
everything they are guidelines and it all comes 
down to where you place buying a car in the level  
of importance in your life and how you want to 
budget for it but one thing you want to remember  
if you're getting a car from a car dealership is 
that they'll play around with the numbers as much  
as they can to keep your monthly payments within 
your budget whatever your budget is for them  
they'll make sure those payments are as close to 
the budget that you say so that they can make the  
maximum amount of money from you and they won't 
ever tell you what the total amount you pay for  
the car is when factoring all the costs and all 
the fees and over the total life of the Carlos  
so that is something you want to do yourself 
regardless of which of the rules or the guidelines  
you're following I have a whole video on how to 
calculate the total ownership and what to look for  
if you're going down the fine that's by Elise Ruth 
and I'll see you over there I'll link it over here"
GS7W6UMeBpA,"number one be happier with your food order I was 
listening to a podcast the other day and they were  
talking about different personality types and 
how when making a decision there is often the  
perfectionist and the pragmatist the perfectionist 
is someone who needs all the information available  
before they make a decision when ordering at 
a restaurant they will need to know everything  
on the menu back to front see each item before 
they place the order whereas the pragmatist is  
someone who is content with having enough 
information to make a decision they don't  
need to know every single detail they'll skim 
the menu and they'll pick whatever they think  
they like the looks of and research shows is that 
the pragmatist personality type is in fact more  
likely to be happier with the decision that they 
make and more likely to get things done with most  
things in life we tend to wait for that one day or 
that perfect moment or that perfect timing before  
being able to do something we find ourselves 
in the state of analysis paralysis Gathering  
every piece of information before taking action 
and this was something that I was guilty of I  
found more often than not it led me to passing 
up opportunities because I didn't have all the  
information available to take it up and I'll just 
stay in the same place day after day but recently  
I've really started to embrace and take into 
the pragmatic approach I'll aim for a certain  
level of understanding or information and then 
once I have that I'll make the decision on that  
thing and I found that since I've been taking 
this approach I'm getting more things done I'm  
moving forward and I'm not getting hung up 
on the small things because at the end of  
the day we can't have all the answers or wait for 
complete certainty before doing something because  
Perfection only exists in hindsight point two 
invest in your ability to start from scratch in  
the book The Almanac of Nevada African there's 
a sentence that's written that really resonated  
with me Naval says I'd like to think if I lost all 
my money and you dropped me on a random street in  
any English-speaking country within five or ten 
years I'd be wealthy again because it's just a  
skill set I've developed that anyone can develop 
this sentence really challenges the notion that  
most people associate with wealth creation they 
think that to make money or to build wealth you  
need to come from an initial place of privilege 
to start with you need money to start with or  
you don't stand a chance instead Naval suggests 
that financial success comes from investing in  
education and high value skills like sales like 
marketing like coding like entrepreneurship the  
better you can get at these high value skills 
that are important in almost every industry  
they align with Market demands the better you'll 
be financially compensated and through this you'll  
be able to create more value in a shorter amount 
of time than what it takes most others the third  
thing is not to be stuck in your ways something 
my dad has often said to me is that you should  
be like water always willing to take the shape of 
whatever vessel you're in when something changes  
when something new happens instead of resisting it 
and fighting against it embrace it and understand  
how you can use that thing to your advantage for 
instance with the whole AI Development I've seen  
different people react differently to it on one 
side there's a group of people that think it is  
the worst thing ever they resist it they think it 
should be contained or stopped and they fear that  
it will lead to mass job losses huge negative 
consequences and then there's another group of  
people who are already using it they've started 
forming their business around it they're using it  
to streamline processes and help them open up new 
opportunities if you constantly resist change and  
hold on to this preconception of what something 
should look like you are going to get left behind  
the world will move on and it's up to you if you 
want to take on the opportunities that come with  
being like water Point number four extraordinary 
results come from doing ordinary things from an  
extraordinary period of time the thing that really 
makes this sentence real for me is the Journey of  
my YouTube channel a lot of people have said oh 
you grew pretty quickly in a short space of time  
but what people don't see is the year of work that 
went on behind the scenes beforehand when I first  
started I'd get nine or ten views maximum on each 
and every single video but I kept going with only  
9 or 10 views for longer than most people would 
have I was consistently producing content and  
putting in the effort to improve with each video 
and after 11 months of starting my channel I hit  
my first 4 000 subscribers trying something out 
and doing it once or twice and basing your success  
on the results from doing it once or twice isn't 
going to get you anywhere it's the consistency  
and the persistence in doing that thing over 
and over again even when there are shinier  
objects and alternative options that come to you 
along the way I've said this before my mindset  
was starting something new is give yourself a 
predetermined period of time that you will try  
that thing for and give it your all during that 
time see how it goes where it gets to and after  
that predetermined time decide whether you want 
to continue or evaluate and if if you want to  
Pivot but embrace the power of consistency and 
understand that extraordinary results are often  
just a product of ordinary actions done diligently 
and persistently over an extended period of time  
don't underestimate the action of showing up every 
day and what that would do for you in getting to  
your goals point five be real about what you want 
this is one that took me years to digest most of  
my early 20s and I do wish I had been real with 
what I actually wanted with myself earlier what  
I thought I wanted in life was one thing but what 
I actually wanted was completely different and it  
was only in the last couple of years where and 
I've said this before I attribute it to this  
planner where it has forced me to look inwards 
and understand what it is that I wanted not what  
society's idea of fun is not what social media's 
idea or fun is just what my definition of a good  
life is and for me it was being able to work from 
whenever I wanted from wherever in the world that  
I wanted to and also having an impact along the 
way and it sounded like a far-fetched stream at  
the time but when you strip away everyone else's 
view on what life looks like and you put your  
energy in to the thing that you really want then 
you're on to something and there's no stopping  
you in my opinion next we have pay to free up time 
I've seen people earning a lot of money but just  
can't spend it they can't pay for something or pay 
for some to do something because they can do it  
themselves and save money in the process but the 
concept of putting a value on your time underlines  
an important part of personal economics that is 
missed in this whole equation your time has a  
certain monetary value and you should utilize it 
in a way that maximizes this value when you spend  
time on tasks that could be outsourced you are 
inadvertently lowering your financial value of  
your time for instance if you earn 50 per hour 
in your job or your business and you spend five  
hours doing a task that a professional could do 
for a hundred dollars you're effectively losing  
out on 150 250 of your potential earnings minus 
the hundred dollars cost by doing this task to  
yourself by spending time on that thing you're 
potentially foregoing the benefits of what you  
can do better and this doesn't necessarily mean 
having to spend every hour of your time doing  
something that can give you returns it also means 
Outsourcing to free up your time it also means  
Outsourcing to free up your mental space and free 
up your energy so that you can be more productive  
on the things that you do work on this is a hard 
concept to follow especially if that thing you're  
Outsourcing isn't directly or indirectly making 
you money straight away but changing the way you  
think about money and understanding that you 
do eventually to get to a point where you need  
to spend money to make money it will end up being 
more economical for you in the long run and number  
seven pay attention to your credit score this is 
boring but it is worth getting right because it  
will save you so much money some of our biggest 
purchases in life are home mortgage a car unless  
you have the cash to buy it outright they rely 
on some kind of debt and so when you do get out  
alone for these purchases you want to make sure 
you're getting the best possible deal on it and  
a key component to that is having a high credit 
score if you have a high credit score or lenders  
perceive you in a good light you're more likely 
to get amongst the best interest rates in the  
market because you're someone that is seen to be 
responsible with their money but if your credit  
score is lower because you didn't focus on it you 
may qualify for a higher interest rate and over  
the course of 5 10 15 years time this can cost 
you tens of thousands it's something that you  
really want to pay attention to sooner rather 
than later so those are seven life and money  
lessons for those of you that made it this far 
I'm not going to be releasing a video next Sunday  
because I'm recording a video every day during 
the week for the money boot camp and there's only  
so much I can face the camera so thank you for 
making it this far and I'll see you in two weeks"
Om7HyERm2ps,"80 of millionaires are self-made the majority of 
the world's wealthiest individuals weren't born  
into their wealth they created it and part of this 
is down to a culmination of the daily habits that  
they've done for years after understanding 
what some of these tried and tested habits  
are and applying these habits to my own life 
I've tripled my income I'm more productive and  
I'm no longer wasting my time or energy on the 
wrong things so in this video I thought it'd be  
interesting to share with you what these habits 
are and how you can apply them to your own life  
let's get into it number one great minds show 
me your friends and I will show you your future  
there's different variations of this quote and 
I wanted to understand if there was evidence  
to back this up and I came across this study as I 
was reading about it which shows that if a friend  
of yours becomes obese you are 45 more likely to 
gain weight over the next two to four years more  
surprisingly however is that if a friend of your 
friend becomes obese your likelihood of gaining  
weight increases by about 20 so even if you don't 
know that friend of a friend it will still have an  
impact on you and that effect continues one more 
person out the same in the study was found for  
smoking and for happiness you are more likely 
to be happy if your friend is Happy while the  
researchers looked for a variety of explanations 
for this the most likely one appeared to be Norms  
if your friend is a beast or a friend of a friend 
is obese that changes your perception of what is  
an acceptable body size and your behavior changes 
accordingly so your friends really are your future  
and the implication is that you don't just need 
to be deliberate about who you're spending the  
most time with you also need to be mindful 
of your entire network and its influence on  
your life number two push out of your comfort zone 
regularly I haven't ever mentioned on this channel  
how it felt when my channel blew up over the last 
six months and it wasn't good starting a YouTube  
channel was one of the most challenging things 
I have put myself through and I was absolutely  
petrified when I first posted my video I had a 
million things running through my head and it got  
worse before it got better when my channel started 
to blow up in December I was on 6000 subscribers  
and I was sent some screenshots from WhatsApp 
groups of people and these are people that I know  
laughing at my videos and pouring out negativity 
about my channel they don't know that I've seen  
it and they probably still don't know but it made 
it at the time that much harder to keep showing up  
and pressing upload week after week knowing that 
there was more to come and I was opening myself  
up to more and more criticism and I eventually got 
to a point where I said to myself do I just stop  
here or do I ride it out and I've learned that 
to get anywhere in life you've got to embrace  
yourself for awkward situations uncomfortable 
moments and embarrassment you're going to be  
judged anyway and had I stopped myself at that 
point my life would be completely different  
today if you stick to your comfort zone and don't 
challenge yourself off even when you have every  
reason to stop you won't ever know what you're 
capable of and you'll be letting go of what could  
potentially be waiting for you on the other side 
next we have don't buy into fomo this is one that  
requires the most willpower and discipline but if 
you're apply it it will pay off we are constantly  
surrounded by images of our friends going out 
all the time going on their next big holiday  
buying a new car living their best life and the 
constant pressure of these messages will make you  
feel that if you're not doing it you're missing 
out but if you constantly let yourself cave into  
these temporary moments you may be sacrificing on 
what you could potentially make from the rest of  
your life you'll be sacrificing time that you can 
spend instead on working on yourself or working  
on your side hustle there is a quote in the book 
Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill which states  
that the starting point of all achievements 
is desire weak desires bring weak results just  
as a small fire makes a small amount of heat 
through this He suggests that the intensity of  
our desires directly correlates with the results 
we get weak desires weak results whereas strong  
burning desires can pave way for stronger bigger 
things in life it's fine to cave in to living  
your best life every now and then but what I find 
difficult to hear sometimes is when the no hustle  
culture is heavily promoted by people who are 
at the top of their game now that they've made  
it big they can afford a team and delegate their 
work and they can achieve that so-called balance  
but they once had that strong burning desire and 
made sacrifices during their climb that they don't  
talk about as much I've learned that the best way 
to not let fomo get the best of you is to find a  
meaning in what you're doing and know that it's a 
part of a bigger picture that you're creating for  
yourself and now every time I feel like fomo is 
taking over and getting the best on me I remind  
myself why I'm doing what I'm doing and that the 
strong desire and all the small sacrifices that  
I make now will all be worth it in the end next 
we have the millionaire pyramid whenever I'm at  
a door that doesn't seem to be opening up for me 
I think about the pyramid perspective mindset and  
it's understanding that the Journey's difficulty 
is inversely proportional to the number of people  
who will reach the top as you climb higher the 
pyramid gets narrower and when difficulties show  
up it's easy for the majority of people to give 
up effectively the crowd will get thinner and  
thinner towards the next level and the harder 
the Journey the higher up you get the harder  
the challenges you face but the fewer people 
there are to compete with and so the rewards  
are bigger hurdles are part of the journey to 
the top everyone who's growing is going to fail  
at some point and if you don't fail you're not 
growing but what you do after failing is what  
differentiates the successful people from the 
rest so now I like to remind myself that when  
things get tough it's just a sign that I'm on 
the right path focus on Solutions not problems  
one habit that has been an absolute Game Changer 
in my life is focusing on the solutions and not  
the problems what I've observed especially among 
successful individuals is this unshakable belief  
that every puzzle or every problem that comes 
up has a solution that everything no matter how  
daunting it is can be figured out they ask 
themselves how can I make this work for me  
whereas everyone else will focus on all the 
reasons why it won't work out every excuse  
they can think of it will be standing in the way 
from them getting to that thing worries are like  
sheep they seem to flock together when you start 
thinking about a problem it quickly compiles into  
another problem another problem and before you 
know it you're overwhelmed with the potential  
for problems so instead of playing the what if 
game to think about all the additional problems  
that one problem can cause play it to think about 
the solutions however serious your worries or your  
problems may seem and even if they do keep you 
up at night if you really analyze them you'll  
find that every single problem has a solution 
number six have a think day this is one that  
I've been doing very recently and it's helped me 
overcome any mental blocks that I have and makes  
me Mindful and makes me sure that I'm heading 
in the right direction in the 80s Bill Gates who  
founded Microsoft began this think week annual 
tradition he would seclude himself in a remote  
location and shut off all of his communication 
he'll spend an entire week dedicated to reading  
learning and thinking this approach then became a 
key part of his life and his process and he said  
think week is a time when I'm can be creative and 
push my own thinking it's a time to step outside  
the day-to-day demands of my job and really focus 
on the big picture I haven't been able to commit  
to a whole week but I have started doing think 
days at least once a month I just step away from  
all my work everything my phone my laptop and I'd 
secure myself mentally I'll spend an entire day  
reading journaling thinking learning something 
new and when you do this you give yourself space  
to really zoom out and take a high level view on 
your life and the bigger picture and the direction  
that you're going in sometimes we're so caught 
up in the grind and working hard that we never  
really take a step back and say where am I going 
and how can I get there more efficiently so this  
is one that I would highly recommend if you're 
able to so those are a few things that I've been  
doing and it's changed my life I'm in a completely 
different position today than I was one year ago  
and I attribute a lot of that to the habits 
that I mentioned in this video anyway thank  
you for watching don't forget to subscribe if you 
haven't already and I'll see you in my next video"
BFyOweu5WiQ,"let's get straight into it number one buy your 
friend's product at full price if you want to  
help your friends who are entrepreneurs then buy 
their products at full price and tell others about  
it there's this mindset to ask for mates rates and 
ask for a discount because the person selling is  
someone you know but by doing this you're actually 
taking from them not giving to them they will  
let you know if they have a friends and family 
discount that is available so the best thing you  
can do for a small business or an entrepreneur 
friend is to buy their product at full price  
and leave them a review number two marry the 
financially stable we are programmed to think that  
money is a taboo topic and it's awkward to discuss 
and so often we don't discuss that with our  
partners at all unless there's a problem in fact 
money is the top reason why couples fight why did  
you spend that much how are we going to pay for 
our bills this month and so when you develop that  
pattern of only speaking about it when there's 
a problem then over time you're going to dislike  
money you're going to dislike talking about money 
or you're just going to dislike your partner  
one of the things that financially successful 
couples do is they talk about money regularly  
and proactively they don't wait for a problem to 
rise before they decide to talk about it laying  
out your financial goals and laying out your 
views on money is something you and your partner  
want to get used to and you want to have these 
conversations sooner rather than later number  
three work from a desk what do you think of when 
you imagine your bed maybe sleep maybe relaxing  
maybe chilling now what do you think of when you 
imagine your desk work productivity maybe a little  
bit of stress that's exactly what your brain 
does every single time you switch environments  
it's something called context dependent memory 
and it's a term for saying that your brain links  
behaviors with the places that you do them when 
you perform a specific task in a specific place  
you'll feel kind of energy that will drive you to 
do that task so working from a desk helps you get  
the work done be productive but also optimize 
for work-life balance when you're able to shut  
your computer and physically move away from your 
workspace you're sending a clear signal to your  
brain that is time to de-stress and switch off you 
want to avoid mixing location energy for different  
tasks next we have think before accepting the 
first offer there's two sides to every story  
and the same goes for negotiations so whether it's 
about to secure a new job or accepting the terms  
on the lease for a new car often the first offer 
that is put on the table is not the best offer  
that the other party can do and it's usually just 
a starting point the other party in most cases  
expects some back and forth and negotiation has 
very much been factored into their initial offer  
so if you're always accepting the first offer 
without even thinking you're very likely leaving  
possibilities and opportunities on the table 
understand the root cause of jealousy this is one  
that really helped me find my journey and what I 
wanted to get out of my life you can't be jealous  
of someone or something that you don't truly want 
yourself for example I'm not the least bit jealous  
of someone who dresses immaculately day in day 
out I I don't want to it doesn't interest me it  
doesn't spark anything in me but if I saw someone 
doing what they truly loved day in day out that  
used to make me feel a certain way and I knew that 
more than anything else that's what I wanted to  
create instead of using jealousy to send negative 
thoughts into the world or to other people put it  
into inspiration use that negative energy and put 
it into motivation when you get that unsettled  
feeling recognize and give yourself room to unpack 
and understand whatever it is that you're jealous  
of and then put your energy into making that 
thing happen for yourself next say less than  
necessary I'm finding more and more two types of 
people in life and specifically on social media on  
one side there's the people who say oh I've been 
working really hard on this book or this product  
or in the service for the last two years and it's 
finally here and you realize that they haven't  
mentioned that at all over the last two years that 
they've been working on it they've been working on  
it in the background and in silence and then on 
the other side there are people who are telling  
everyone they meet about how they've got all 
these big plans coming up and watch the space and  
there's something coming soon and then you don't 
hear about that thing again nothing comes from it  
it's so easy to get the kick and the validation 
you need from posting about doing the thing and  
telling everyone about doing the thing instead of 
actually doing it by saying less than necessary  
I don't mean gatekeeping information or being 
secretive about the knowledge you have I'm a big  
believer in absolutely the opposite I'm an open 
book on this YouTube channel but I do believe that  
to do anything great and to really set yourself 
apart you need to spend more time doing the thing  
than talking about doing it next we have eating 
healthy this is a key part that gets forgotten  
about in the hustle and grind and it's so easy to 
just get a takeaway or get an ubereats when you  
have a million things to do but if you have your 
health in check you're able to perform better you  
can work Less hours and more productively so you 
want to eat healthy now at the moment my life is  
a bit chaotic I've got different things that are 
going on even when I'm not able to spend time to  
cook an organically healthy meal a product that 
I've been relying on recently is hewell who are  
very kindly sponsoring this video you already 
know that I have been a paying a customer for  
heal for the past two years now and there are 
two products that I have been really enjoying  
recently one of them is they're ready to drink and 
I've been getting deliveries for this monthly and  
it's a whole meal a whole nutritionally complete 
meal in a single bottle and the second thing I've  
been loving recently as I'm getting back into my 
exercise routine is their protein powder I add 300  
milliliters of cold water first and then one scoop 
of complete protein I then give it a good Shake in  
my heel Shaker which I got for free with my first 
order along with the t-shirt and you could get the  
same using the link below so thank you so much 
fuel for sponsoring this video and for helping  
me make sure I'm getting all my proteins and my 
minerals into my diet next we have read every day  
there is a constant Chase for mentors and we often 
think we need a mentor to unlock opportunities to  
unlock possibilities we need a mentor to get past 
a certain level we need to be around a certain  
group of people to level up what we often miss is 
that everything that we need every skill that we  
need to learn every problem that we need solved 
can be figured out somehow through the internet  
through a podcast through an interview through a 
book books are the most radically condensed form  
of knowledge in the world you can get someone's 10 
years worth of knowledge and experience condensed  
into a book that you can read over a weekend if 
I really want someone to be my mentor and they're  
so far Out Of Reach I'll listen to every podcast 
they have every interview and I'll read every book  
written by them next we have focus on practicality 
a lot of us get tied up with this whole find your  
passion find your purpose BS and we put so much 
equity on it that we don't get started on anything  
until we have a clear view on what our passion or 
purpose is but the truth is that very few people  
are successful from finding their passion on their 
first go and then making a living from it it's so  
hard to do and it takes months and years of trying 
other things first and seeing what sticks focus on  
learning skills that are practical focus on skills 
or businesses that are practical all these things  
that you try may not be the thing that leads to 
what you where you want to be eventually but it  
will definitely help you in getting there it will 
put you further than just sitting and waiting for  
your passion and purpose to come to you before you 
get started next we have spend time in solitude I  
went to a motivational talk recently and the 
speaker asked the 2000 people in the room to  
stand and he then said If in the last seven days 
you have spent more than seven consecutive waking  
hours away from your phone then sit down and no 
one in the room sat down he then reduced those  
seven consecutive hours to five hours so if you've 
spent more than five waking hours away from your  
phone then sit down a few people sat down he 
then reduced it to three hours maybe about 100  
or so people sat down and then one hour and the 
majority of people in the room stood standing most  
of us can't spend time away from our phones and 
researchers show that due to smartphones we have  
a harder time concentrating we don't know what to 
do with our down time or our boredom and we feel  
anxious when we don't have our phones because 
we feel like we're missing out on something if  
you want to live a life that is different from 
everyone else's and you want to do things that  
other people aren't willing to do spend some time 
every day by yourself without your phone and take  
this time to reflect on where you are and where 
you want to be Choose Yourself I've been having  
a lot of conversations recently from different 
people from different walks of life and I don't  
know what it is but every single conversation 
I've had with the person has been around starting  
something new and doing something different and 
taking a different path but the thing that stops  
them or stops anyone is always external factors 
my family don't believe it I don't want to get  
judged I feel like I'll get laughed at and I've 
always said this as long as you're doing what  
you want and you're not hurt or harming anyone 
else and doing it don't for a second focus on  
what the external noise and people around you are 
saying don't let the opinions of others stop you  
from living your life we are the sum of all our 
different choices and only you have to deal with  
your life's consequences so choose yourself and 
don't let other people have the power to choose  
you and this is a bit of a bonus Point here as 
I add on from the previous point and that is to  
influence rather than be influenced don't doubt 
the value that you have to give to the world you  
may not feel like you're an expert in anything 
but your story is a very unique story whether  
you're super successful or not there will never be 
anyone who has your background and your story so  
use it to your advantage and where possible spend 
more time producing rather than consuming that's  
it guys thank you for watching if you like this 
video you may also enjoy another video that I have  
on how I'm upgrading my finances this year and 
also another one that I've got on five Financial  
mistakes I've made and what I've learned from 
them thanks for watching and see you next week"
961vZxJkp5I,"your daily life is run by subconscious programming 
which controls what you think what you do and how  
you perceive the world and what most people don't 
realize is that when it comes to finances we are  
playing against a rigged system and we have 
been conditioned by the schooling system to  
stay poor formal education does not include 
any depth of financial literacy training no  
trace of budgeting of taxes of Investments 
of the mechanics of starting and running a  
business and none of that so the majority of us 
don't know how to go into the financial world as  
anything other than paycheck to paycheck workers 
after spending nine years in Investment Banking  
I'm going to share with you some of the most 
important money lessons that school failed to  
teach us and how you can break out of the cycle 
number one the money equation when we observe  
self-made billionaires like Elon Musk Bill Gates 
Jeff Bezos we find a Common Thread that ties the  
success stories together in stark contrast to 
what we've been taught growing up these people  
have shown us that money isn't just a simple 
equation of salary earned from a job it's so  
easy to fall into the Trap of thinking that the 
amount of money wyan is directly tied to the  
amount of time we work but through my own journey 
and having now seen a completely different side  
of the money equation I've realized how limiting 
and misleading this belief can be for instance  
say you earned 20 an hour and you work 40 hours 
a week it would take you nearly 25 years to reach  
a total of 1 million dollars but that isn't 
without you even subtracting any taxes or any  
expenses over the 25 years nor does it account for 
inflation so really you'd be left for far less and  
on a salary of 20 an hour you can only become a 
millionaire through a combination of working very  
hard and being Frugal your entire life what sets 
Millionaires and especially billionaires apart  
is they're fundamentally different understanding 
of money they've understood and applied the power  
of a different model equation that isn't taught 
in schools or even in most households they know  
that wealth creation is less about exchanging 
time for money and more about leveraging assets  
investing wisely and creating systems that 
generate income for them even when they're not  
working understanding this is the first step in 
breaking out of the conventional system them don't  
believe that the only way you can make money is by 
trading your time for it number two the timing of  
investing during your lifetime you're likely going 
to see three to five major economic downturns and  
these periods may seem scary and you probably 
think of it as a time to cut back and really  
save but these periods also often present the 
most significant opportunities to build wealth  
whilst there are so many people worrying and 
holding tightly onto their savings during this  
time the rich are quickly deploying their money 
into Investments they're buying stocks they're  
picking up real estate they're essentially betting 
on a brighter future and so when the market does  
eventually bounce back and it recovers like it has 
done historically these investors ride that wave  
of recovery back up ending up even richer than 
they were before on the other hand those that  
stick to just saving during these times will find 
life more expensive as inflation takes as tall and  
when the market recovers these people miss out on 
the gains because they weren't invested to begin  
with you want to get yourself into the habit of 
regularly consistently investing start learning  
about the different invest assessment Avenues 
take informed risks and be consistent doing so  
can be the difference between achieving Financial 
Security in the next five years or continuously  
playing catch-up the power of investing over 
just saving is such an important lesson in  
personal finance that can completely redefine your 
financial future this is me just starting off on  
all the finance stuff that hasn't been taught 
to us and I'm going into more detail in my five  
day money bootcamp that is coming up and it is 
completely free we will talk about all of this  
money psychology and how companies use strategies 
against us investing the stock market pay Rises  
is going to be good so if you want to join the 
rest of us you can sign up using the link below  
and if you're watching this and the link isn't 
there it means it's come and gone number three  
understanding leverage for many of us that is 
seen as a burden but for the rich the same concept  
of debt is referred to as leverage and this 
distinction is not just semantic it represents  
two entirely different ways of thinking about and 
using borrowed money Mark Zuckerberg despite his  
immense wealth took out a six million mortgage 
to buy his home in California Beyonce and Jay-Z  
they finance their 28 million dollar house with 
a 52 million dollar mortgage Elon Musk took out  
a 50 million loan against his five properties 
in California if debt is so bad why are these  
multi-millionaires who have the money to pay for 
these things outright taking more and more of that  
the key difference is how the money is used is it 
being used to create more money or is that debt  
being used to drain your money for the majority 
of people debt comes in the form of Consumer loans  
used for purchases that don't make any money like 
a new TV or a holiday whereas on the other side  
the rich often use leverage to make more money 
they use it to buy assets that I appreciate over  
time like real estate or business ventures and 
a mortgage is amongst some of the cheapest debt  
you can get and so these multi-millionaires use 
borrowed money to buy their homes which means  
they can use their money on other things and on 
other assets that have higher returns essentially  
turning debt into an asset you want to understand 
the difference between debt and leverage and how  
you can use it for you instead of against you 
number four avoid social proof there is a whole  
phenomenon around keeping up with the Jonas says 
and it's defined as the social pressure to match  
or surpass one's Neighbors in material possessions 
and social status and the concept goes beyond just  
comparisons with your neighbor is ingrained 
in today's society influenced by Friends by  
celebrities by social media trends and in today's 
digital age where our lives are completely and  
constantly on display this pressure is more than 
ever we often measure our self-worth by the number  
of likes or comments our posts received by 
what we wear and this can lead to us making  
financial decisions based on the desire for social 
validation rather than for practicality and buying  
expensive things or luxury items isn't bad the 
problem is when these purchases are driven by the  
desire to appear wealthy rather than reflecting 
actual Financial Health and it's better to live  
within your means and make financial decisions 
based on personal needs rather than long-term  
financial goals and succumbing to the pressure 
of keeping up with the Jonas says this lesson  
although very rarely taught in school is pivotal 
in maintaining Financial sanity in a world that  
prioritizes appearance over substance number 
five understanding tax this is an important but  
completely neglected part of our education system 
and there are so many ways to legally reduce your  
tax bill that people just don't know about or 
want to educate themselves on in the world of  
the rich knowing the intricacies of tax laws and 
capitalizing on legal loopholes is common practice  
but it's not just for the ultra rich or business 
owners of the world as an employee you can also  
increase your non-taxable income sources through 
for example retirement contributions it's about  
understanding the system and making it work 
to your advantage I've got a specific video  
on which I will link here up somewhere if you 
want to understand how it can apply to you but  
that's just me touching the surface tax laws can 
be complex but understanding the basics and how  
they apply to you can save you thousands in the 
long run lesson six focusing on production in  
my video on habits keeping you in the rat race I 
talk about how your net worth can be calculated  
by the difference between your production and 
your consumption money will come into your life  
because you've performed some sort of value which 
is the production side of it and money will leave  
your life through through consumption through you 
spending money a lot of people in the personal  
finance space Focus purely on the consumption side 
of the equation and I wish more people spoke about  
and put an emphasis on the production side of the 
equation but I also know why they don't because  
it's easier to reduce your expenses through 
the amount you consume than it is to increase  
your production value and increase your income 
and when you're talking to a mass audience you  
know that the consumption part will resonate 
with more people there's nothing wrong with  
the strategy and it works for a lot of people on 
different levels of income but let's be honest if  
you look at the same people that are giving the 
advice take Dave Ramsey for example whilst his  
advice is often centered around savings and living 
debt free his success lies in the production side  
of the equation he's making money through giving 
guidance on the consumption part and as much as it  
is helpful to listen to these words you also want 
to pay attention to their actions his estimated  
net worth of 200 million dollars didn't come from 
focusing on the consumption side of the equation  
producing is about providing relative value in a 
market Market in some way shape or form and this  
doesn't have to come from a day job or starting a 
business it can even come through something like a  
YouTube channel and that's one of the things that 
I've done to create value on a mass scale whilst  
getting paid for it and increasing my production 
value at the same time your form of production  
may be creating a digital product or creating a 
course on something you have extensive knowledge  
about or developing an app or a software that the 
market will pay money for if you can produce value  
at a large scale it means earning money at a large 
scale so you want to avoid thinking that there's  
only one route to increase your income I hope you 
enjoyed this video and it sparked something in you  
to think expansively and do something that maybe 
you've been putting off for a while if there's  
anything else that you found that school hasn't 
taught us and you wish you learned it sooner then  
let me know I'd love to read that thank you so 
much for watching and I hope to see you next week"
WSoqUdd39-Y,"we are taught from a young age to follow a certain 
path go to school get good grades get a good job  
get promoted but after achieving these Milestones 
what's next what should you do with the money that  
you've earned it seems like the focus on financial 
guidance disappears after the good job part when  
it comes to Payday there is a lot of conflicting 
advice on where you should put your money and in  
what order do you pay off debt do you save 
do you invest we are continuously fearful of  
making the wrong choices so what actually is the 
optimal order for investing your money if you're  
new here I'm Nisha I'm a qualified accountant 
and on this channel we talk about all things  
personal finance and self-development and in 
this video I'm going to share with you what I  
personally believe is the most optimal order to 
invest your money and set you up for the future  
number one build up a safety net before you 
invest in the stock market before you invest  
in real estate before you invest in equipment for 
your new business you want to have a safety net  
this is the very first thing you want to do Focus 
number one before you do anything else is save one  
month's worth of expense and put it into a high 
interest savings account that you can easily ask  
success whenever you need to without paying any 
fees I want to clarify something here is that  
financially optimal for you to instead pay off 
your debt before you say for an emergency fund  
yes but being mathematically optimal is different 
to psychologically optimal and the psychological  
comfort of knowing you have a small emergency 
fund and that you won't need to go into debt to  
pay for a unexpected expense frees you from a 
lot of additional stress and this isn't money  
to then spend on everyday expenses this emergency 
fund really needs to be kept away forget you even  
have that out of sight start off with one month's 
expense this will cover most small emergencies and  
you can look into adding to this after you do 
the next step first and that is paying off your  
high interest debt the majority of adults are in 
debt and we've accepted this as the norm we may  
have bought a new car that we could have bought 
used we may have bought something that we didn't  
even need to impress people that we don't even 
like and one of the biggest problems with debt  
is that it restricts your monthly income if you 
have high interest debt that is eating away on  
your income it massively restricts the amount 
you can save and the amount of everything else  
that you can do instead if you focus on paying 
off debt that is a tax-free risk-free guaranteed  
rate of return if you have credit card debt that 
is charging you 20 then by paying off that debt  
you're making a guaranteed return of 20 on that 
printer support the interest that you'll no longer  
be paying the very first High interest that you 
want to pay off is your credit card debt forget  
about meal planning forget about cutting costs in 
any other place this is where you're going to take  
the biggest step towards Financial Freedom so what 
is high interest now I would Define High interest  
debt as anything above eight percent interest some 
people say six percent others say 10 the reason I  
chose eight percent is because historically when 
investing in the stock market you can expect to  
earn about 10 annually and when you adjust 
this for inflation it's around eight percent  
so to me anything above what you could earn in 
the stock market is going to be high interest  
debt but what about mortgages or other smaller 
loans usually the interest on that isn't as high  
as credit card debt or overdraft fees so you can 
continue making the minimum payments on those and  
to The Next Step instead but before we get into 
it I want to let you know that I'm doing a free  
five-day money program it's going to be five days 
of videos where we cover a different topic every  
day from asking for a pay rise money believes 
saving investing and it's completely free the  
launch date will be confirmed in the next few 
weeks I'm really excited for this so if you  
want to know when it launches then sign up using 
the link below with that aside number three on  
my list of order is what you will hear a lot of 
personal finance people talking about doing a step  
one as it's free money how could you be saying no 
to free money but the reason why I don't think it  
makes sense to put this as number one is because 
it's something that you will benefit from in 20 30  
40 years from now and that doesn't matter if you 
can't get your finances today in a good place to  
start with so once you have steps one to two done 
then you want to take the match that your employer  
is offering you for your retirement fund this is 
called different things in different countries  
in the UK it's the pension contribution and the 
US you would have heard it as the 401K and what  
this means is for every pound or dollar that 
you contribute your employer will also match  
that contribution put that towards your pension 
so say you're earning a hundred thousand and you  
contribute 4 000 of that towards your workplace 
attention your employer matches everything you  
put in so you're basically making 100 return 
on your investment straight away remember this  
is different from the full amount that you can 
contribute all you care about here is contributing  
whatever you need to get the full match because 
otherwise you're just leaving free money on the  
table and unfortunately for these retirement 
matches that employers provide as a benefit  
you can't claim it retrospectively so you can't 
claim it now for previous years so you're going  
to repeat this one every single year you never 
want to miss out on this free money step number  
four have an additional fund imagine the kind of 
freedom and stability you'd have if you had three  
to six months of your living expenses in your 
bank account at all times knowing that if anything  
happened you lost your job your business didn't 
work out then you would have something to fall  
back onto and that will all be taken care of this 
is when you want to have enough money available so  
that if anything happens you can bail yourself out 
and not rely on credit card debt to get you out of  
your situation so you want to work out what is the 
absolute minimum you need to survive on so your  
fixed expenses your variable expenses your total 
expenses for the month and then multi apply that  
number by three to six months if you're employed 
or nine to twelve months if you're self-employed  
this number is your emergency fund and it's 
different to your safety net that we spoke  
about in the first point this is for the larger 
Financial shocks that we just mentioned that have  
longer term implications now once you've done that 
this is where it gets fun because you've completed  
the groundwork for a truly free financial future 
now you get to invest and meet some of your other  
Financial priorities so the next step is to invest 
through a tax advantage account the reason why  
you absolutely want to do this is because it's 
one of the most tax efficient places you can be  
putting your money in to make it grow most other 
Investments buy some sort of tax when you buy  
a share and make money from it you usually have 
to pay capital gains tax however when you invest  
through a tax advantaged account such as an Isa if 
you're in the UK or a Roth IRA if you're in the US  
you Shield your profits from the tax man so you 
want to take advantage of these accounts up until  
the maximum if you can then we have a payoff low 
interest debt this includes for example student  
loans in some cases and sometimes car loans from a 
financial standpoint this debt may not be hurting  
you as as much so you can choose whether you want 
to pay it off or instead use that money to invest  
but my personal perspective is that unless this 
step is being used to help you make more money  
if it's not helping you do that then you should 
be paying it off so if you're using that money  
to invest rather than to pay it back then it 
may make sense but if you are not paying off  
your debt because you rather have more money 
left over to spend on things that you enjoy  
then I would instead consider paying off when you 
consider debt as a normal way of life it can very  
quickly Cascade into a mindset of justification 
and using it to fund an elevated lifestyle with  
low interest debt is something you want to avoid 
you want to get into the habit of paying off as  
much bad debt as you can from your life then we 
have paying off your mortgage this is the last  
thing on the list and I would highlight that it is 
completely optional and it really really depends  
on your financial situation there are so many 
variables that you have to take into account how  
much Equity do you have left when does your fixed 
rate end how long do you have left personally in  
my situation I would not pay off my mortgage right 
away instead I would choose to use that money  
to invest because mortgage rates are typically 
some of the cheapest debt you can get and they  
have long-term commitments that have already been 
priced in to be paid over the full term so instead  
if you wait to pay off your mortgage before you 
decide to start investing you're really limiting  
your time in the investment Market that can take 
away from some of the benefits of compounding  
and long-term growth and on top of that making 
overpayments can save you money on interest in the  
long run for your mortgage but not all mortgages 
are flexible so before you make any overpayments  
you want to make sure you check the terms of your 
mortgage and see if overpayments are allowed or if  
there are any early repayment charges if your 
mortgage doesn't allow overpayments or limits  
them for example for 10 a year then it might make 
sense to put that extra money into Investments and  
by doing this you're building up a separate pot 
of money in your Investments and adding value  
to your property simultaneously both of which 
will help your financial future of course there  
are psychological benefits to paying off your 
mortgage and living mortgage free so ultimately  
depends on what's more important to you one of 
the things I haven't spoken about on this list  
is putting your money towards skills and personal 
development you could only save and invest as much  
as you can earn but you can always earn more and 
brilliant.org who are very kindly sponsoring this  
video is a really good online platform where you 
can learn the skills you need to land those higher  
paying jobs brilliant has thousands of interactive 
bite-sized lessons they're very fun learning paths  
and they make it very easy to learn new things 
stay on track and also get real-time feedback  
if you've watched my videos you know that I'm the 
least tech savvy person and it takes me forever  
to understand anything technology related but I'm

tHpC5QMPdAs,"the average person spends two and a half hours 
every day on social media and so if you find  
yourself saying you don't have the time to do 
something it usually means you don't have the  
motivation or the discipline to spend time on that 
thing so today I'll be talking about four very  
small things that I started doing last year that 
helped me find pockets of time throughout my day  
that I didn't know I had and doing these things 
is what helped me work a full-time job run this  
YouTube channel manage a property project and try 
a lot of different side hustles whilst also having  
some sort of social life it can be done so let's 
get into how you can stay committed to allocating  
your time on the right things number one turn on 
flight mode this is arguably the most important  
one on the list and having just this one thing 
under control will make such a difference to  
your productivity it's scientifically proven that 
dopamine has a direct impact on the decisions we  
make and the actions we take and our surroundings 
have been constructed to tap into this reward  
system that we have huge companies are designing 
their products to release as much dopamine as  
possible in order to keep us coming back from 
more and more and the worst part of it is that to  
indulge in these sources of instant gratification 
it takes us zero effort we can literally sit on  
our sofa or sit in bed and consume and we are 
rewarded with massive hits of dopamine for doing  
nothing and this will hijack your time and energy 
as much as you let it when I started tracking my  
screen time and you could literally do this by 
searching screen time on the top screen of your  
iPhone and it will show you how many hours you 
spend and on which app and when I started seeing  
how much time I was wasting I did two things the 
first thing was conscious scrolling what I mean by  
this is understand how you feel after using your 
phone dopamine doesn't know what's good for us and  
what isn't so it's up to us to differentiate when 
I feed my mind with purposeful inspiring materials  
I feel motivated I feel inspired and on the days 
I'm mindlessly scrolling I feel drained and I  
feel like I've got myself in a rut and I'm being 
unproductive thinking about how you feel after  
using your phone is a really strong indicator 
of whether or not you're consuming the right  
content for yourself and if it's not making you 
feel uplifted then change up what you're seeing  
in your feed and make the decision to unfollow 
things that aren't adding value to your life  
the second thing I did is use personal mode I 
set this up so it's automatic between a certain  
time every day pretty much between nine to five 
my phone turns itself on personal mode and so I  
won't get any notifications unless I actively go 
into these apps and check the notification myself  
and if I'm taking things really seriously or if 
I have a really busy day I'll put my phone into  
another room all together completely out of 
sight and I've seen people take this one step  
further and put it in a jar or put their phone 
and lock it up in a cupboard so whatever floats  
your boat to make sure your phone isn't going to 
distract you or you're not going to keep picking  
it up whilst you're working number two make it 
a no-brainer you want to pair the Habit that you  
are trying to build which is often difficult 
to start with because it requires motivation  
it requires discipline and requires willpower and 
you want to pair that thing with something that  
you like to do and this is especially important 
in the early days when you're trying to build a  
new habit because that thing hasn't yet built an 
automatic neural pathway yet I actually want to  
show you how I use this I want to show you my 
work from home setup if you look at this room  
what do you notice something about the position 
something about the way it's set up something  
about where everything is placed and this was done 
on purpose there is something James Clear says in  
the book The Atomic habits and he says that our 
desires and our environment often influence our  
habits we want things simply because they are an 
option in front of us at the time and he uses the  
example of how our living rooms are set up if you 
walk into your living room very likely your couch  
is facing the TV which makes it a no-brainer for 
you to come home after a day of work sit on the  
sofa turn on the TV encourages that habit and so 
now going back to my office space again or my work  
from home set up the first thing that you see and 
the thing that the whole room is essentially based  
around is my diocese it's a feature of this room 
it's almost the sole focus of the room it has the  
best view and everything else faces it and has 
completely changed my mindset by shifting those  
all up and it's had an impact on my motivation I 
don't have any resistance in me just sitting down  
and getting to work because this is one of the 
nicest areas in the flat I enjoy being in here to  
make more money and be productive and work on your 
business which requires a lot of self-discipline  
you want to set up your environment to make that 
process enjoyable and that takes care of a lot of  
the motivation that you need and because I spend 
a lot of my time working and getting carried away  
in this place I then end up working myself to a 
point where I forget to eat and I end up skipping  
a meal which is just not good so now a product 
that has helped me solve this issue and makes it  
a no-brainer for me to get my nutritional meal in 
every day is hewell who are sponsoring this video  
if you've watched my other videos you know I have 
been consuming fuel products since way before I  
started this YouTube channel and in the past year 
as my workload has just ramped up it's been the  
thing that's helped me stay on top of everything 
stay disciplined it's helped me stay committed to  
what I said I was going to do whilst also getting 
all my vitamins and minerals into my diet I keep  
the ready to drink on my desk which makes it a 
no-brainer for me to make sure I'm getting my  
nutritionally complete meal every day it comes in 
eight different flavors my personal favorite being  
the berry and the iced coffee caramel it's also 
gluten-free it's low in sugar and it's plant-based  
so if you're like me and you're someone who 
just wants to get everything that you need  
into your diet while spending the least possible 
time thinking about it then this is a no-brainer  
if you want to try it out there's a link in 
the description box below and with your first  
order you also get a free t-shirt right now I'm 
energized let's get to point three number three  
time blocking the night before when I know I'm 
going to be busy and I have a lot to get done I  
time block absolutely everything I set aside two 
slots to check my emails I schedule in my break I  
schedule in when I need to return a parcel I go 
as far as scheduling when I need to drink water  
if it's not my schedule I'm probably going to 
forget about it or it's not going to happen and I  
do this for two reasons first only two percent of 
the world's population can actually multitask and  
researchers say that when we hear the statistic 
the other 98 of us think that we are the ones that  
fall into that two percent but the truth is just 
by focusing on one thing at a time and having a  
specific time allocated to it you can really work 
deeply and our focus and productivity increases  
and the second reason I do it is because it helps 
me focus on types of tasks based on the zone or  
the mood I'm in so again research shows that we 
are not good at doing creative and Lodge School  
tasks at the same time so I have a Time block 
usually in the mornings for my creative tasks  
like researching YouTube creating a thumbnail and 
then having another time block for my logical or  
admin task that uses a different part of my brain 
doing this and separating these tasks out helps  
me fully immerse myself in whatever the task is 
ideally I'll spend a few minutes blocking out  
my key tasks for the next day the night before 
so that is one less thing I have to worry about  
in the morning knowing your priorities and what 
your day looks like ahead of time will help you  
focus on executing the tasks rather than deciding 
what to do next number four Choose Yourself first  
if you've watched my videos you know I go on 
about paying yourself first or you do anything  
else before you pay for your social plans before 
you pay for your travel you want to pay yourself  
you want to take 10 minimum from your paycheck 
the day it comes in and put it aside for your  
Investments or savings by doing this you're 
choosing yourself in the same thing goes for  
your time you can either choose to start your day 
checking your emails and doing everyone else's  
priorities and what they want you to do or you 
can choose yourself and start the day by doing  
the things that will make the most difference to 
you if your manager asks you to do something by 10  
AM you'll do everything in your power to make sure 
that thing is done and completed by 10 am you will  
show up and you will deliver for the company you 
work for but when it comes to doing something for  
yourself that one task that you need to do to take 
your project to the next stage you're most likely  
going to make up a million different excuses 
but you want to prioritize your tasks and do  
it first wake up a little bit earlier and commit 
to getting that thing done before you check your  
emails or before you check your notifications 
before you let anyone else enter into your  
mental space getting into the habit of choosing 
yourself is one of the most important things  
you can do to make sure you're living according 
to your own values and working towards your own  
goals rather than helping someone else achieve 
theirs so those are four small things and for  
small habits you can change and Implement to make 
sure you're making the most out of your day make  
sure you're being productive and focusing on the 
things that will matter and will have the biggest  
impact on where you are now and where you'll be 
this time next year thanks for watching don't

mQbEeZsu-3k,"saving investing making money that's all well and 
good but if you don't know how to protect your  
money none of that even matters fraud accounts for 
over 40 percent of all crime in the UK and when I  
asked you on Instagram if you or anyone you know 
has been impacted I was surprised by the number  
of stories that came through a small group of 
creators were invited to 10 Downing Street to  
talk about how the government is looking to tackle 
this issue and it got me thinking about all the  
different ways we can protect and diversify our 
money so in this video I'm going to share with you  
four things you can do to protect your money and 
I'm going to explain what the government is doing  
and how you can utilize it to make sure you're 
not left behind number one mind over money a few  
months ago I got a call from my mum and the first 
thing she said was I'm on my way home to transfer  
the money to you from my computer I asked her 
what she was talking about and she told me that  
we have been speaking over WhatsApp for the past 
half an hour she sent me screenshots of the back  
and forth messages she had with someone who she 
thought was me and they started off saying hey  
mum I've just broken my phone and I've got a 
temporary number and my mom responded saying  
is this Nisha and then the conversation started 
and it went on and I'll put it on the screen so  
you can see the exchange of conversations and 
blast my mom even asked a scammer if she could  
cook them dinner they then asked her to transfer 
money and that's when she called me to me this  
was obvious that it wasn't me it didn't sound 
like me it didn't even come from my number so  
I asked my mum why was she going to transfer money 
to someone who clearly wasn't me and her response  
really hit me she said when you love someone so 
much you'll never question them when they're in  
need and that's exactly what scammers try and take 
advantage of they use these emotional triggers to  
make you act fast without letting you take a step 
back and actually think they'll pose as someone  
close to you and rely on forcing you into Heat 
of the Moment decisions it's very hard to put  
mind over money when it comes to these situations 
but you want to have a measure in place with your  
family members or people close to you to stop 
things like this from happening when we make a  
payment we usually get a notification for asking 
if we recognize the person we're paying and it's  
so so easy to just confirm and say is okay but 
you want to use this as an opportunity to take  
a step back and think about what the consequences 
can actually be I've got a rule now with everyone  
close to me and that's if we ask each other for 
money it has to be over video call or we say a  
specific code word number two have a rock solid 
vs detector one of the most useful skills you  
can have in personal finance is a good BS radar 
you know the feeling you're scrolling through  
social media or scrolling through Instagram at 
work and you come across an ad promising you a  
get rich quick schema showing you a lifestyle 
that you could have if you invest your money  
into this thing you start imagining all the ways 
you're going to hand in your resignation letter  
with the 50 return that you're going to get from 
this opportunity when something looks too good to  
be true it usually is just that data from the 
national fraud intelligence Bureau shows that  
young professionals are the most likely targets 
of investment fraud and in most cases victims have  
seen an influencer advertise the investment 
scam on social media so it doesn't matter  
who is promoting it you always want to test the 
legitimacy of that thing for yourself and one of  
the major well Flags you can look for in personal 
finances when someone is selling something to you  
as a guarantee or with 100 certainty that is going 
to happen so for example you are guaranteed to get  
20 return on this investment or buy this stock now 
and you will double your money nothing in personal  
finances 100 guaranteed and there is always going 
to be an element of risk involved as a benchmark  
the average stock market return over the past 
20 years has been eight to ten percent and if  
someone's offering you something significantly 
higher than that it's probably not legitimate  
and you want to look into it further number three 
high risk and alternative Investments it's really  
easy to get sucked into high risk Investments 
when everyone else around you is doing it and  
that is the trend we saw it with crypto we saw 
it with nfts the thing is to remember that these  
opportunities that could have a high reward are 
also very volatile and one of the golden rules to  
investing is to spread your money across various 
investment types which will reduce your risk and  
protect your money from fluctuations in the 
market by spreading your money across various  
types of Investments you're essentially reducing 
the overall risk of your portfolio and it's kind  
of like a safety net because when one investment 
doesn't perform well the others can help balance  
things out when I talk about various types of 
Investments I'm talking about a mix of assets  
like stocks bonds mutual funds real estate and 
then a portion of higher risk Investments if  
you're okay with the level of risk involved in 
that a common piece of advice that I see amongst  
Finance YouTubers or Tech talkers is to stay away 
from credit cards full stop with general advice  
like this you want to take it with a pinch of salt 
because unlike maths where there is a sure answer  
with personal finance it isn't a one-size-fits-all 
approach and personal finance advice whoever it's  
coming from needs to be tailored to suit you 
you're using credit cards to buy things you  
can't otherwise afford and you're not able to 
keep up with the minimum payments then you do  
want to question its benefits for you but on 
the other hand credit cards can offer some  
really valuable protection for example if you 
buy something with a credit card and that thing  
is later stolen it's lost or it's destroyed or it 
wasn't as advertised you'll get that money back  
from your credit card provider and it's not just 
purchase protection that your credit cards help  
with you also get extended warranties in most 
cases if you buy something with a credit card  
they'll often extend that warranty or even double 
it so that's a lot of money you are spending on  
warranties that you can actually keep so now 
what is the UK government doing and how does  
this impact you firstly the government is working 
with big tech companies including social media  
platforms to let you report fraud with one single 
click so hopefully all those impersonations of me  
will be dealt with a lot sooner the government is 
looking to implement an outright ban on SIM card  
Farms which allows scammers to send thousands of 
text messages all at once which hopefully means  
those texts that my mom got will be reduced and 
the government is also looking to put a ban on  
all cold calls selling Financial products so if 
you get this type of call you can be immediately  
suspicious and you know it's a scam there are two 
things that you can already start using today if  
you forward a suspicious text to 7726 which spells 
staff on your phone keyboard your phone provider  
can investigate where that text came from and 
look to ban the sender from sending you or anyone  
else more text messages the second thing if you 
receive a call from somebody claiming to be a  
trusted organization like your bank asking you 
to transfer money you can hang up and call 159  
to check if they are legit this hotline has been 
around for almost two years and I didn't even know  
about it and this is one of the reasons creators 
were invited to 10 Downing Street to help create  
awareness around these topics so that we can let 
you know what's available to you and hopefully if  
this message doesn't just stop here and you can 
pass it on to people who you think resonate or  
it'll be helpful for if you want to read the full 
policy I'll leave a link below for you and if you  
prefer to have it summarized in a video format in 
an entertaining way then Damien talks money also  
has a video on that if you found something useful 
in this video please share it will cost nothing  
for you but it could save someone else thousands 
and a lot of emotional stress it's not my usual  
type videos but it is important and like I said 
at the start all the hard work in investing and  
budgeting and making money all those things that 
we otherwise speak about on this channel doesn't  
matter if you're not able to protect your money 
thank you for watching and see you next week"
uiTVzOeALGQ,"how should I invest my first one thousand dollars 
I often get asked this question should it be in  
real estate in index funds individual stocks 
Metals crypto there are a million different  
things you can choose so in this video I'm 
putting myself or where I was five years  
ago and breaking down exactly how I would go 
about investing one thousand dollars if I was  
starting from scratch today the first I is for 
insights the first step in getting anywhere is  
first understanding and being aware of where you 
are right now it sounds so simple and obvious but  
as Tony Robbins says self-awareness is in fact 
one of the rarest human Commodities and when it  
comes to money we all have our own patterns and 
habits that shape our financial situation and  
we want to First understand what those patterns 
and habits are and then figure out which aspects  
of our financial life from those patterns and 
habits need our attention first maybe you feel  
like you're not earning enough money or maybe 
you feel like you are earning enough but you  
don't know what to do with it you don't know how 
to manage it or maybe you feel like you don't  
know how to repay your debt and it's holding you 
back we should take the time to really understand  
what's holding us back and what's keeping us 
in the same place year after year and then by  
doing this we can come up with a solid plan to 
then address those specific challenges investing  
at its core is about committing resources to 
achieve future benefits so before we can start  
making smart investment decisions we need to 
take a step back look at our current position  
and identify what's holding us back then we can 
create a plan to invest our money in the areas  
where we can reap the future benefits that would 
have the most significant impact to our lives  
number two new skills and business according 
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics most people  
um they're hard-earned money on accommodation food 
transportation and then 10 on Leisure and only one  
to two percent of their net income in personal 
development this means things like education  
training courses books it's one of the best ways 
you can invest one thousand dollars but it's also  
the most neglected because people don't think of 
the longer term benefits When You're investing in  
something that's not necessarily tangible for 
example let's say only making 50 000 a year  
you decide to invest one thousand in courses that 
teaches you a new skill that's in high demand in  
your industry after completing the course you get 
to negotiate a raise or a better paying job that  
increases your income to sixty thousand a year 
that's a 20 increase in income a return that's  
very difficult to get anywhere else investing in 
yourself means taking time and money to develop  
your skills and learn new skills like selling like 
content creation like money management things that  
you want to hone or skills that you want to own 
but you don't know how to you might even consider  
hiring a coach a mentor investing in equipment 
that'll help in your career or your business  
when you invest in yourself you're essentially 
increasing your earning potential and creating  
more opportunities for yourself number three 
value and this means things that you value not  
anyone else things that you understand things that 
align with your investment strategies definitely  
don't invest in something just because it's what 
everyone else is doing and just because it's what  
everyone else is investing in if your friend is 
investing one thousand dollars in crypto but you  
have five thousand dollars of credit card debt 
you're in two very different positions and the  
value of that one thousand dollars is also very 
different so whilst it may be a good idea for  
them you are probably way better off using that 
one thousand dollars to pay off your credit card  
debt so think about how you want to spend your 
time your money your energy and make sure that  
it aligns to your values it may be that you value 
having less stress and don't mind a low return  
for the sake of less rest and you also don't want 
to spend too much time having to worry about your  
money in that case maybe index funds or Target 
date funds are a good option for you or maybe you  
don't mind taking big risks you don't mind taking 
big breaths in exchange for a big reward and you  
have a lot of disposable income but you don't mind 
losing then maybe Angel Investing or more risk  
your Investments are for you understand your risk 
appetite and invest in things that align to your  
values number four experiences you've probably 
heard countless times that you should spend on  
experiences rather than on things and there have 
been countless studies which discover the science  
behind why spending money on experiences does 
in fact lead to Greater happiness than buying  
material possessions and it comes down to three 
key reasons the first is because of something  
called hedonic adaptation is basically the idea 
that the happiness boost we get from buying  
something new is temporary and we eventually will 
always return to our Baseline happiness level  
think about getting a new bag for example you'll 
love it at first and then the novelty eventually  
wears off and you're eyeing the next one on the 
other hand experiences can keep making us happy  
through memories and through emotions even when 
they're over it's an everlasting feeling the  
second reason is that we don't usually compare our 
experiences to others material possessions often  
signal our status and success but experiences 
are very unique they're very personal so don't  
so we don't fall into the comparison trap as 
easily thirdly experiences tend to be shared  
with other people and that means forming social 
connections and bonding material possessions on  
the other hand are often enjoys by yourself number 
five Solutions think about the problem you're  
having where are you right now where do you want 
to be and what is stopping you from getting there  
part of this comes down to the Insight point that 
we spoke about earlier in the awareness piece so  
it involves understanding where you are where you 
want to be and removing any obstacles that will  
stop you from getting there two months ago I felt 
like I was spending a lot of my free time creating  
content that I didn't have any room or capacity 
to focus on anything else I couldn't create a  
website I couldn't reply to a load of emails I was 
getting day after day I felt like I was doing the  
same thing but not moving any closer towards my 
bigger goals and the solution was getting more  
people on board and Outsourcing more things and 
also getting an amazing virtual assistant who has  
helped me tackle things that were stopping me from 
getting to the next stage the same thing applies  
to money what is the thing that is keeping you 
where you are and in the same place is that not  
making enough money is there not having the skills 
to get you to the next stage in your career you  
want to think about the reoccurring problem that 
keeps holding you back and then find a solution  
or learn the things you need to to get to the 
next stage bridge the gap number six travel a  
study found that frequent travel can improve 
cognitive flexibility and creativity and the  
study surveyed 100 professionals and they found 
that those that traveled more and more frequently  
had higher levels of cognitive flexibility and 
they were able to generate new ideas and so of  
problems better this doesn't mean spending a lot 
of money it doesn't mean having to travel abroad  
or going very far it just means getting out of 
your own space going to the park and going and  
working from somewhere different just getting out 
of your usual environment this has helped me so  
much one day a week I'll work from somewhere 
new it could be the cafe it can be from my  
parents home it could be changing out my office a 
little bit or changing some of the furniture this  
will give you a break from your usual routine and 
changing things up and making your day-to-day feel  
like a bit of an adventure in itself will make you 
feel so much more motivated when people think or  
speak about investing they usually just think of 
two things the stock market or real estate what  
we don't think about are the other things we can 
invest in business self-development education and  
very often investing in this outpaces the return 
you get from the stock market which brings me to  
the sponsor of today's video who I am so excited 
to be working with because I am a big fan of  
anything that can take complicated information and 
explain it simply and brilliant.org does just that  
it's a super good online education platform that 
has courses in mass and data analysis and computer  
science in programming a lot of different things 
that are foundational to your learning whatever  
field you're in from a self-employed point 
of view one of my favorite courses is the  
one on data analysis the lessons help you grasp 
a solid understanding of how to read data how to  
understand data how to analyze data and then 
there are interactive exercises that you can  
show you how you can use that knowledge to improve 
your business to think strategically and increase  
your revenue and another course that I've just 
started is the programming with python course

in-demand programming languages if you're looking

8fyIX9CDZ50,"I used to think the harder I work and the more 
hours I put in the more money I would make be

my own personal experience and a lot of wasted  
time literacy papers from productivity experts and 
lessons from some of the most successful business  
people in the world let's get into it the first 
thing I did was put myself in the right auction  
room I was paid less than my worth for years not 
because I like the skill set but because I didn't  
put myself in the right room if you're thinking 
you should be making more money than what you're  
getting find a market that holds more value to 
your skills so what do I mean by this a friend of  
mine owned a piece of land it was passed down from 
his parents and he knew he could make some money  
from it so he put up for sale through a local 
auction in Oxfordshire which is just outside of  
London and he made a 25 profit two months later 
that same piece of land the same location same  
size exact same everything was listed for sale by 
the new owners on a London website and sold for  
100 profit that same piece of land fetched a far 
higher price purely because it was on the right  
auction website where there was more demand and 
where the value for that land was significantly  
higher I reflect on this analogy in other areas of 
my life I worked in a bank where I felt like I was  
being underpaid years after years I was asking for 
a pay rise and I was told I was at the maximum for  
my corporate title for whatever reason I decided 
to move to a different organization with the same  
experience the same set of skills same years of 
knowledge and I got paid 30 percent more this is  
what I've learned in life if you're not getting 
what you want from the room that you're in then  
leave and knock on another door I have a set of 
skills be it numbers analytical skills speaking  
whatever but as I put myself in different rooms 
and different industries that exact same set of  
skills is valued completely differently so it's 
not always about okay how do I improve my skills  
or how do I work more to show my worth but instead 
how do I maximize my earning potential by putting  
myself in a room where my skills are going to 
give me the greatest rewards where will your  
skills reap the greatest return so that you're 
not working for less than your worth number two  
the Steve Jobs rule this rule is one that you 
can apply to so many areas of your life your  
career your relationship your businesses and I've 
coordinate the Steve Jobs rule because he applied  
this principle to turn Apple around and stop it 
from going bankrupt it's the Pareto Principle  
and it suggests that 20 of the cause creates 80 
of the results in relationships we get 80 of the  
Joy from 20 of our partners Behavior we aware 20 
of our clothes eighty percent of the time well  
maybe 100 of the time for me and when it comes 
to my YouTube 20 of my videos have brought in  
Eighty percent of my revenue and subscribers when 
Steve Jobs came back to Apple and the company was  
struggling financially the first thing he did was 
identify where eighty percent of the Prof profits  
were coming from and he cut the remaining products 
out and for a long time Apple's brand was based on  
the iPad the iPhone and the Mac it's not always 
going to be 80 20 it can be 70 30 or 90 10 but  
the point is the majority of results come from a 
minority of causes and the reverse is also true  
the minority of results come from the majority of 
causes and I use this concept to make more money  
whilst working less I think about what 20 of my 
to-do list is going to produce 80 of the results  
and I focus only on those areas which have the 
highest return on investment I align my day so  
that I can give the most Focus to the projects 
that pay the most and then move on to the lower  
impact projects after the cash cows have been 
tended to number three is set an achievement  
date I'm the sort of person that if I plan to try 
something new I'll spend ages trying to make sure  
I understand every single thing and that I have 
a plan for every possible outcome before I even  
start however I have learned that this is far 
from ideal one to actually make more money and  
work less I need to make sure I don't stay in the 
emotion phase for too long and there's a quote on  
this don't mistake activity for achievement to 
produce results tasks must be well organized and  
properly executed otherwise it's no different from 
children playing around in the playground lots of  
activity no achievement so now when I have a new 
idea or a new project one of the first things I'll  
do is set an action date when I first wanted to 
get into real estate I would spend weeks months  
learning every single minute detail that I can 
and get my head around every number and then  
analyze every part of every deal three times over 
what would the returns be what are the properties  
selling for finding out who has put in an offer 
what price what returns are they making and I  
just didn't for whatever reason put the offer 
in I wouldn't pick up the phone and say this is  
my offer and part of this was because I was too 
concerned about what would happen if my offer was  
accepted then I need to do all the work and what 
if I didn't work out what if I then lost the money  
I was so stuck in the motion phase the wheels were 
moving and I'd done all the preparation that I  
needed to that I felt like I was getting somewhere 
and I was on my way to making money but I actually  
just wasn't making the money I wasn't taking 
the final step to get me to the end result I  
wasn't taking the action needed for me to stand a 
chance to make more money so now whenever I start  
something new I would first pick an action date 
for when I'll do that thing and work backwards I  
can always move it around but I'll give myself 
a non-negotiable date or when I move from the  
planning stage to the action stage so that I'm not 
working for longer than I need to doing the wrong  
thing knowing that you have something that you're 
working towards will help you get out of your own  
head and get to the results you're looking for 
quicker the fourth thing I did was focus on value  
over hour to escape the time for money trap you 
need to create scalable and automated source of  
income that are not directly tied to your time for 
most of us in day jobs the main way we think about  
increasing money is by either working longer 
hours or increasing the value in your existing  
role to increase your salary and this was also 
my thinking for many years the issue with this is  
that it comes with the limitations there is only 
so much of your time you can sell I mentioned in  
one of my other videos I have a friend who's a 
personal trainer before the pandemic she used  
to do one-to-one coaching sessions she would go 
do this through her local gym she would go to  
people's houses she would train them she'll do it 
through her gym she was fully booked and she had  
almost 50 clients when she got comfortable with 
the one-to-one she started expanding doing group  
sessions hiring rooms running workout events but 
after a point she realized it became impossible  
to keep taking on more clients to keep hiring 
bigger rooms because no matter what she did she  
just didn't have more time to give she was capped 
she could earn a bit more here and there but there  
wouldn't be any sharp increases in her income 
then the pandemic hit and she went online she  
started off making free content whilst at the same 
time building an app that tells people what to eat  
what workouts to do and then when the app launched 
the majority of our clients signed up to the app  
friends were recommending other friends who were 
recommending other friends and there was no cap  
to how many people could sign up and therefore 
how much money she can make through it she was  
putting in the same hours but making more money of 
course the latter may be more risky it's a riskier  
route to start at that point there isn't always a 
guarantee that will work out but the rewards can  
be much greater if you want to make more money 
by working less to get out of the Rat Race you  
want to change your perception of working to 
sell your time for money think about a skill  
you have that can add value to the most people 
possible and think about using that in a way that  
can positively impact others and what the biggest 
problem you can solve can be the fifth thing is to  
be the captain and there is something that Naval 
ravacan tweeted that has really resonated with me  
over the last year and is that what you choose 
to work on and who you choose to work with are  
far more important than how hard you work and that 
really tells you everything you need to know about  
working smart it doesn't matter how hard you're 
working if you're not working on the right thing  
and even if you are working on the right thing 
no matter how capable you think you are you will  
always get to a point where to take it that much 
further you need to work with the right people and  
there is a saying that is the captain commands but 
the Rovers steer and it highlights the importance  
and the role each person plays and how they all 
work together to make sure the boat is sailing  
in the right direction in the same way if you 
constantly get bogged down in the day-to-day  
task and you get fully involved in rowing 
you won't be able to see the bigger picture  
and know whether or not the ship is even sailing 
in the right direction a way to make more money  
without doubling your time or working harder is by 
working on the business spend your time working on  
the business and then get the support of others 
who are more skilled than you are in different  
areas to work in the business so those are five 
things that I've been doing to make more money  
whilst working less if you want ideas on income 
streams you can start which don't require you  
selling your time for money then I have another 
video here that you may enjoy thank you so much  
for watching don't forget to subscribe if you 
haven't already and I hope to see my next video"
LW7Ii-216aU,"having spent nine years of my life working in 
Investment Banking and three years studying  
accounting I have seen first hand the middle 
class habits that keep people in the rat race  
that keeps them tied to a job they don't like to 
sustain their lifestyle whilst their greater life  
goals and Ambitions are placed in the background 
so in this video I'll walk you through what these  
habits are and how you can avoid them number one 
working for less than your worth this is one of  
the biggest mistakes people make it's common 
practice for employers to pay their employees  
less than what they deserve and so they will pay 
their employees the least amount possible and just  
enough so they don't quit how many people do you 
know whose employers haven't given them a raise  
at all or if they have is something insulting 
like three or four percent Which is less than  
the rate of inflation so essentially despite you 
having another year of experience you're getting  
paid less than you did the year before and then 
when you leave the organization they try to hire  
someone else they realize they need to increase 
the salary in order to get anyone else to take the  
job a middle class habit is just accepting this 
the way it is because it's comfortable you know  
you're getting paid x amount on X day no matter 
what but this habit will keep you in a cycle and  
finding a new job elsewhere could actually be 
the best decision you can make when it comes  
to getting out of the Rat Race a more typical pay 
increase when you move between organizations is 10  
to 20 far higher than the three to four percent 
you would have got if you stayed in the company  
and if you're working hard and you're putting 
your soul into something and you feel like you're  
getting underpaid it is okay to leave and go to a 
competitor so Network learn about other Industries  
go find out what the market is paying for your 
role and have that conversation you may think that  
moving and starting from scratch is inconvenient 
but if you're getting paid 30 more which you can  
then put into your Investments to give you another 
source of income it may well be worth it number  
two buying more than you can afford when people 
get their first full-time job they get a promotion  
or a bonus they tend to upgrade two things the 
first is their car because even if you don't have  
the money to buy a full you can still afford the 
lease payments and of course this is structured  
in a way to make you buy a more expensive car 
than you can afford and it's also the number  
one wealth killer it will keep you working to pay 
off the loan as long as you let her what you want  
to do is either buy a car outright if you have the 
money for it or make sure your car finance payment  
is within the recommended guidelines the rule of 
thumb is to spend no more than 15 of your annual  
income towards your car so if your annual income 
is at 60 000 you should aim to spend no more than  
9 000 per year on a car and that amount should 
include the car payment insurance maintenance  
and any other Associated expenses the second 
thing people will look to upgrade is their home  
because again banks will lend you four or five 
times your salary to purchase your house so even  
with a marginal increase in your salary you can 
afford a lot more home but you don't want to buy  
more home than you can afford the rule of thumb 
here and the general guideline is that you don't  
want to be spending more than 28 of your income 
on your mortgage payments that's 28 of your gross  
income income before tax if you want to learn more 
about the different ways you should be managing  
your money and where you should be allocating 
it I have a money MBA five-day email course it's  
completely free and every day I email you with how 
you can make the most out of your money and one of  
those emails goes over the recommended percentage 
of where your money should be going this will be  
linked in my description if you want to check it 
out number three relying on one source of income  
if we have learned anything from the last few 
years is that relying on one source of income  
is extremely risky the pandemic calls millions 
of people to lose their jobs and we're seeing the  
same happening again with more and more layoffs 
being announced by having one source of income you  
are one incident away from not having any incoming 
cash flow and a middle class habit is to just rely  
on one source of income being their day job by 
doing this you're putting your whole livelihood  
and financial responsibility in the hands of your 
employer and this is a super risky position to be  
in so to break free from the rat race you need 
to diversify your income streams get a second  
job whether it's babysitting being an Uber driver 
starting an online business or investing in other  
cash generating assets like the stock market or 
real estate giving all your financial power to  
your employer is a slippery slope that you 
really want to avoid next we have ignoring  
the importance of saving for old age imagine if 
you were walking on the streets and you dropped  
fifty dollars because you had a hole in your purse 
and then the same thing happened the next day and  
the next day you wouldn't let that keep happening 
you would either fix your purse or you'd get a new  
one and the same thing applies when it comes to 
investing yet very few of us act on it even though  
we are aware that by holding back on investing 
every day we're essentially losing out on the  
ability to let that money compound we still don't 
do anything about it and a lot of that is because  
of the lack of tools and resources to help you 
get there knowing what to invest in or knowing  
what's right for you and as Naval ravikant States 
in his book The Almanac you're not going to get  
rich renting out your time you must own Equity a 
piece of a business to gain your Financial Freedom  
if you don't know where to begin then two that 
you can start with are index funds and a Target  
date fund that builds a portfolio based on the 
retirement year you choose the sooner you put  
your money down for retirement the better off 
you'll be next up we have consumption versus  
production money will come into your life and 
then I'll leave this is a relationship that is  
often looked at in terms of income and expenses 
and another way to express this is by looking at  
in terms of production and consumption money will 
come into your life because you have produced some  
sort of value and for the majority of us this 
value will come in the form of Labor a job money  
will leave when you have consumed something and 
you house a car Netflix subscription in one way  
we can look at the financial position of an 
individual by determining their relationship  
between consumption and production and for a lot 
of people that equation is negative in fact the  
average American holds a debt balance of ninety 
six thousand dollars and the average personal  
debt in the UK is over 33 000 pounds the money 
is leaving quicker than it's coming in you want  
to recognize how this is impacting your financial 
position and both reduce the consumption part of  
the equation whilst putting as much money as you 
can into the production value the sources where  
the money is coming into your life next we have 
ignoring financial literacy Financial Mastery  
has a huge impact on our lives whether we like 
to admit it or not we put so much importance on  
our well-being our mental well-being our physical 
well-being but so little actually on our financial  
well-being when really this plays an equally 
important role in our enjoyment in life it might  
just be excusable not to invest in our financial 
literacy in our early 20s we're busy living life  
dating seeing new places having expensive items 
and because we don't have much money to begin  
with the consequences of our lack of financial 
literacy are actually limited however if we carry  
that mindset through with us to our 30s and to 
our 40s and don't bother developing our knowledge  
base of financial literacy it'll become harder 
and harder to undo and this will echo through  
to the rest of our lives there are basic things 
you should understand understanding tax rules  
understanding what your income and expenses 
are knowing how to get the most value out of  
your money this isn't taught at school so it's up 
to us to learn about it and if you want to know  
more about any of these topics then let me know 
and I'll make that for you but just by ignoring  
this and not wanting to learn about it you'll 
stay in a place where you keep working for money  
number seven doing what everyone else is doing in 
today's society we are really Under Pressure to  
spend and we have to do it to fit in this applies 
to everyone whatever your income level is I have  
worked with people who are making a lot of money 
way into the six figures but they are still living  
paycheck to paycheck because they are spending to 
impress and to lick rich and to show everyone how  
rich they are instead of actually being rich and 
Building Wealth if you're spending on clothes and  
bags because you enjoy it and because it brings 
you happiness then that's one thing and I'm all  
for spending on things that brings you happiness 
and joy but spending on it to keep up with what  
everyone else around you is wearing and to post 
on your social media to show everyone else what  
you're wearing rather than for your own happiness 
that's another thing altogether and this is what  
keeps the middle class in a never-ending cycle 
it is a status driven Society but you need to  
find why you're making money and working hard 
what do you want to achieve and how do you want  
your life to look like whether it's to travel 
business class everywhere or to quit your job  
and never see your boss again as long as it's in 
line with what your value is and it's not dictated  
by anyone else's that is what will get you out 
of the Rat Race the rat race isn't about working  
a nine-to-five job it's about a living life on 
such an edge where you are always chasing the  
next thing whether it's a paycheck or a material 
possession in a way that your greater life goals  
and your Ambitions are placed in the background 
in order to keep continuing this race hopefully  
this video gave you some ideas or triggered some 
thoughts into habits that you do not want to go  
down thank you for watching if you enjoyed this 
video you may also enjoy another video that I  
have on habits that made me six figures by 24 and 
I'll link that over here hope to see you there"
32gZhfwU1ZI,"the average person spends hundreds if not 
thousands every month on their car payment but  
by changing the way in which you buy a car you can 
reduce this payment by almost 50 percent and so  
in this video I'm going to show you how it works 
and how you can get a new electric car for almost  
half price I'll run through two different ways you 
can buy a car how the numbers work differently for  
both of those and which one will save you the most 
amount of money and finally we will go through the  
other factors to take into consideration when 
buying a new electric car this video is part of  
a series of account and explained videos where we 
discuss all things personal finance and Building  
Wealth to show you how it works I'll be using the 
Tesla Model 3 as an example with a few additional  
features that no one really needs or asks for 
to bring the total value of the car to a round  
number of 50 000 pounds to keep things simple I'm 
going to assume you're buying the car outright the  
first way you can buy the Tesla is through buying 
it outright under your personal name so with this  
method you make money or you get paid your salary 
you then pay tax on that salary and then from  
the amount left over you buy your car so using 
some numbers as an example if you're an employee  
working for a corporation let's say you're earning 
75 000 you first pay your taxes on that 75 grand  
so in this case income tax and ni which totals 
around 25 000 which then leaves you with just over  
52 000 pounds and from that 52 000 pounds you buy 
your 50 Grand Tesla so you now have just over 2  
000 pounds left over then we move on to the second 
option and this is where it gets interesting  
and that is buying the Tesla within a company 
structure this would be on the basis that you are  
a business owner or that you have a side hustle 
of some sort and you're operating as a company so  
there are a lot of different benefits of operating 
under a company one of being the massive amount of  
tax savings I'm not going to go into the details 
in this video because I have a whole section of  
it covered in another video and I'll link that 
over here for you as well so now buying your car  
under a company is specifically beneficial for 
new electric cars because firstly they are 100  
tax deductible which means you can write off 
the full price of a new car against your profits  
from that year and secondly the reason why it's 
beneficial is because they get a lower benefit in  
kindway and I'll explain what that means in just 
a moment but first let's look at the numbers and  
how it works in this scenario so if you bought the 
Tesla through your company then instead of buying  
the car after you pay tax you buy the car before 
you pay tax so it's using the same numbers as we  
did in scenario one let's assume the company 
made 75 000 pounds now if you buy your Tesla  
within your company it means you can write off 
the full value or the full price of that car in  
the year that you bought it so instead of paying 
corporation tax on the 75 000 you now pay tax on  
the 25 000 so after the 50 000 expense this means 
instead of paying 16 000 incorporation tax which  
is what you would have paid on the 75 000 you now 
pay less than five thousand this is almost an 11  
Grand saving or discount if you will on the car 
which then leads to the question is this really  
a business expense and is it legal to write off 
a car from your business if you're actually using  
it for personal purposes or personal use so 
for example I'm here making YouTube videos on  
what basis can I justify a Tesla for my business 
this is where the benefit kind comes in and why it  
makes so much sense to buy an electric car under 
a company so benefiting kind is defined as goods  
and services provided to an employee for free or 
at a greatly reduced cost and the government again  
sees this as some sort of payment or value to you 
and therefore usually imposes a tax on the value  
of that good or service so for example if your 
workplace pays for your health insurance although  
it's free for you you are still technically 
paying tax on the value of that benefit and  
this is because the policy is treated as a benefit 
in kind and so if this were a non-electric car you  
were buying it under a company but using it for 
personal use you would still have to pay a large  
personal benefit account so it doesn't always 
make sense to buy a non-electric car within  
your company as after you pay your benefit and 
kind amount and the other taxes it might actually  
work out better off buying it under your personal 
name however it does make sense for electric cars  
because the benefit in kind of rate is much lower 
for government the government wants to incentivize  
as many people to buy clean cars and so they've 
introduced different benefit and kind rates based  
on how energy efficient your car is and so for 
something like the Tesla it's ridiculously low  
it's currently two percent of the value of the 
car so two percent of the 50 000 in this case so  
that's one thousand pounds every car has a benefit 
and high percentage based on their CO2 emission  
and I'll link the table below for you so you can 
see what rate applies to which car depending on  
the CO2 emission so you would then be required to 
pay personal tax on that benefit of kind amount  
so that means you'll be paying 20 if you are 
a basic rate taxpayer on the 1000 pounds or if  
you're a high rate taxpayer you'd be paying 40 on 
that one thousand pound benefit and kind amount  
once you add this benefit find and the class 1a 
contributions to this amount the total tax you pay  
between the company car and the corporation tax is 
just over 5000 pounds which means you have over 20  
grand left over even after buying the car that's 
a huge difference that means with the same 75  
000 pounds in earnings under scenario one you 
have 2 000 pounds left over and a new Tesla and  
under scenario two you have 20 grand left over 
and a new Tesla and so essentially given the tax  
savings you're getting from buying an electric 
car within a company you're in a way getting the  
Tesla for nearly half price that's almost 20 grand 
that you wouldn't otherwise have and it's a great  
opportunity for you to invest in something that 
will instead compound over time like stocks and  
shares one of the ways I do this is by using an 
investment platform like trading 212 so you can  
use that amount to invest in a general investing 
account or even better in a tax-free ISO account  
where the gains and profits are tax-free trading 
212 has a deal at the moment where you can get one  
percent cashback on any amount that you deposit 
into your Isa and so that's even more in savings  
if you want to check it out you can download the 
app or visit the link below and if you enter the  
code Nisha nischa you get a free share worth up to 
a hundred pounds it is worth noting however before  
you go and invest that 20 grand that when you sell 
the car through the company the sale price will be  
seen as profit and therefore you will have to 
pay corporation tax on that amount which will  
partly offset the tax savings but you'd still 
be financially better off than you would have  
under option one so what are the other things 
to consider when it comes to an electric car  
and can you save money in other areas firstly 
the general maintenance cost of electric cars  
are lower the car doesn't have an engine so there 
are barely any maintenance or service costs at all
there's no congestion charge there's no Road tax 
and the cost of charging your car is personally  
lower than Fuel and also it's 100 tax deductible 
and the same goes with insurance insurance is a  
bit more expensive than it is for non-electric 
cars but it's also 100 tax deductible so although  
I don't always Advocate buying a new car the 
tax savings on buying a new electric car can  
really back up when the price of used cars is 
so high at the moment buying a new electric  
car and utilizing all the tax advantages that 
come with it may be an option to consider and  
when you factor in all of the costs you can 
write off the price of the car the charging  
cost the insurance cost the saving depending on 
how much you drive can be huge and over 50 I've  
assumed you're buying the car outright but you 
can also look at lease and finance options as  
well and if you are looking to buy a Tesla then 
by going through my link below you also get 1  
000 free supercharge points hopefully this gave 
you some things to consider if you are on the  
edge of buying an electric car if you're looking 
into buying one if you found this video useful  
please share it it helps spread the awareness of 
financial education to more and more people and on  
the topic of cars I also have another video on 
whether you should buy a finance or at least a  
new car I'll leave you with that over here thank 
you so much for watching and I'll see you there"
tmTysUZN36M,"we all know that money is an emotional topic but 
what we don't realize is that these emotions play  
a huge part in our bad money decisions so in 
this video I'm going to share with you five of  
the biggest emotional traps that I've learned 
from the psychology of money and how you can  
avoid falling into them number one pay the price 
this is one that very few people understand that  
everything you have and do comes at a price 
whether it's a monetary price in dollars or  
cents or an emotional price like fear or doubt or 
stress nothing is free and this is especially true  
when it comes to investing because the price 
you pay isn't just the price of the stock or  
the amount you invest in it's also the emotional 
volatility and the fear that comes with it which  
isn't always intuitive in other areas of your 
life for example if you go to the gym today it  
may hurt a bit tomorrow you'll feel sore and then 
three months six months nine months down the line  
you will see results but people tend to take these 
short payoff periods and apply it to investing you  
think that by checking back at three months or in 
six months time the results will show but that is  
where the emotional trap comes in let's say you 
bought an S P 500 Index Fund in the 1980s yes  
one can argue that it went up 11 000 since then 
but you would still have needed to face about  
13 years combined where your Investment Portfolio 
was down 20 from its high and eight months when it  
was down 50 it's only after paying that emotional 
price and sticking it out through those downfalls  
that you would have then benefited from the 
compounded results and the longer you're able  
to ride out that volatility the fear the worry the 
doubt and stay invested the more your money would  
work for you and as housel says good investing is 
not necessarily about earning the highest returns  
because the highest returns tend to be one of 
hits that can't be repeated it's instead about  
earning pretty good results that you could stick 
with which can be repeated for the longest period  
of time number two the magnitude of chance this 
was a bit of a difficult one for me to digest that  
first but once you understand it you'll change the 
way you think about earning and who to learn from  
when it comes to making money there are so many 
elements that come into play that are outside of  
your control and they have a bigger impact on 
the outcome than what we would have done even  
intentionally for example our upbringing our 
ethnicity gender which part of the world we  
live in and housing states that one of the main 
reasons we fail to become financially successful  
is because we underestimate the role chance 
plays in our financial lives ignoring chance  
or luck is dangerous because many people try to 
gain wealth by imitating the most exceptional  
successful people if we see someone make a lot of 
money very quickly we tend to look at that person  
and say okay how does she or he do that and how 
can I copy that to be just as successful but due  
to the fact of chance locked the right place 
at the right time the odds won't necessarily  
stack up in our favor he uses the example of 
Bill Gates Ultra successful huge net worth  
and you can say he achieved his success because 
he was a super smart and super hard-working but  
what we don't always think of is the fact that he 
also went to the only high school in America with  
a computer and he was literally one in a million 
teenagers who had access to a computer so having  
that accessibility was the chance element in his 
story that contributed massively to his financial  
success forget to look at the wider picture what 
were their circumstances when did they do it what  
was the wider market like how long have they done 
it for so house explains instead of focusing on  
the individual it's better to focus on broader 
patterns to maximize your probability of success  
so if one person did X to get wealthy but many 
people did why to get wealthy doing why will  
have a bigger probability of you gaining financial 
success number three wealth is what you don't see  
this is probably the most important one on the 
list and one that as a society we often fail to  
see we are social beings so it is no surprise that 
we need social validation but actually craving for  
social validation makes us worse off and a reason 
why so many of us failed to achieve financial  
success is because we confuse use being wealthy 
with being rich rich people can lack wealth but  
we can't see that they do their current income is 
high so they have the money available to be able  
to spend on expensive items and tangible items 
and so we confuse perception with reality whereas  
on the other hand it's hard to identify a wealthy 
person because they save their money you can't go  
into their bank account and see the money that 
they're not using Hope from the book that says  
rich is what we see what we are wearing the bag 
we're holding the jewelry we're wearing and on  
the other side wealth is what we don't see it's 
the cause not purchased the diamonds not bought  
to the renovations postponed the clothes will 
gone and the first class upgrades declined so  
knowing the difference between being wealthy and 
being rich is really important because we learn  
by imitation and so knowing who to imitate and who 
not to imitate can help us grow our money and grow  
our wealth you understand the difference between 
being rich and being wealthy and start learning  
the habits of what a wealthy person does you can 
prevent yourself from draining away your money and  
protect it number four use money to buy control 
this is the lesson that has probably resonated  
the most with me and whenever someone asks why 
I'm not spending money on buying this or buying  
that it's because my sole focus is to use that 
money to create a life that I want using your  
money to buy time and options has a lifestyle 
benefit few luxury goods can compete with and  
money buys you optionality and control of your 
life more than our salary our corporate title  
or Prestige of our job instead to do what we want 
when we want with the people we want that is one  
of the things that brings the most happiness that 
comes with the privilege of having wealth it may  
come with sacrificing on other things for the 
time being and I also have a specific video on  
the things that I no longer buy to and my plan 
to get to this stage but it's all in the name  
of focusing on what is really the best value for 
your money and the big ticker items and that is  
to create a life that you have always wanted 
and having the freedom and control over your  
time number five contrasting narratives we're 
all very familiar with this one but very few of  
us implement it we all know having money and and 
being able to manage it gives you control but how  
much money should you have well there are studies 
that show how your income has diminishing returns  
on your personal life satisfaction and Beyond 
a certain point more money stops buying you  
further increases of Happiness Until you realize 
that the goal post on how much you want to earn  
will keep moving the advice in the book is to 
know when to say enough there is a limit to the  
value that money can bring into our lives it's 
about finding the balance between accumulating  
wealth and preserving what truly matters things 
like our relationship health and your overall  
well-beings too often people get caught up 
in the pursuit of more and more money more  
possessions more success without taking a step 
back and considering the potential consequences  
and this can cause sacrificing our physical 
and mental health the damaging relationships  
or even risking what we already have and our 
financial stability in the pursuit of making  
more and in the book he gives examples of how 
Ultra successful people risk everything they  
have in the pursuit to get more and damage their 
reputation and everything they have they risk it  
all just to get more money that they didn't even 
need it's easy to forget this when you're seeing  
people around you spending their money and all 
the marketing messages telling you how you should  
be spending yours on one side you'll get the 
messages saying you need to live frugally to  
be rich and you'd save to be rich and on the 
other side you need to quit your job and be  
traveling and be living your best life and with 
these contrasting narratives it's very easy to  
Lose Yourself within that money up to a certain 
point will buy you freedom and control and then  
after that that value needs to come intrinsically 
know who you are and what matters the most to you  
so those are the five most important lessons 
that I've taken away from this book highly  
recommend it and I've been applying it to many 
parts of my life I'm interested to know if you  
have fallen into one of these emotional traps 
either subconsciously or consciously and now  
that you're aware of the trigger what you'll be 
doing to come out of this cycle thank you for

cwhoSwCB3lc,"hi everyone welcome back to the channel
in this video I'm sharing with you 10
things you can do to keep more of what
you ate doing these 10 things of which
most of them take less than five minutes
has left me with so much more money left
over every month without sacrificing on
my quality of life so let's get into
what they are number one switching bank
account this is such an obvious one but
so few people do it by opening a high
Interest Bank account you could earn
almost 10 times the national average of
a basic current account many online or
app-only accounts offer even higher
rates because they have lower overheads
and so to make the most of your money
put your emergency fund and your income
straight into a high interest savings
account that's easily accessible and
then for your long-term saving goals
that you don't need to access at least
for the next year or two consider
putting that into a fixed rate account
that typically offers even higher
interest rates there is however an
exception to this rule where switching
to a high interest savings account might
actually make you worse off and I'll go
into that in a bit more detail later in
this video number two reshuffle your
energy consumption the government has
just extended the energy price guarantee
for a further three months but right now
energy bills are one of the highest
fixed expenses for the majority of us
and so this is a place where you can
really make some changes something I saw
recommended was to turn your thermostat
down by one degree this sounds
ridiculous but the world health
organizations suggests that 18 degrees
is the ideal temperature for healthy
adults by turning your thermostat down
by one degree you can save between 10 to
15 percent of your heating bill and
another thing you can change which will
save you the most amount of money with
your energy bills according to the
energy saving trust is to proof your
windows and doors the third thing that
I've done which has been the highest
return on my time investment is
measuring where my money is going most
of the spending we do is done on
autopilot but you'll be surprised at how
much you can actually save just by
knowing what is coming in and out of
your account and research shows that the
most effective way to do this is instead
of using a monthly tracker where you
will leave out a lot of the one-offs is
to instead use a yearly tracker so spend
a day mapping out your in-goings and
outgoings over a year and then as you go
through your tracker ask yourself three
questions firstly can I pay less and get
that same thing somewhere else secondly
do I need it and thirdly if I do need it
can I live with it less of it you can
use any early tracker you could create
your own if you want to use the same one
that I use I have a link to that in my
bio the fourth thing to do is turn off
the dripping tabs if there was a
dripping tap in your home you probably
wouldn't think anything of it you
wouldn't even think it's that annoying
but over time it will accumulate and a
lot of water will be wasted and the same
thing applies to your finances you
probably have small things that are
slowly picking away at your finances and
you want to turn them off this means
subscriptions for reoccurring payments
for things that aren't a necessity like
Beauty subscriptions Amazon Buy and Save
subscription when you set these
subscriptions up to be automatic you
will find that you're probably spending
more money on them than if you instead
paid for that service every time you
used it the thing is paying off your
high interest debt and in the majority
of cases you want to do this before you
save money and before you try to switch
to any High interest savings account
which I spoke about in the first point
put simply when you save money you're
actually lending your cash to the bank
for it to lend on to other people and
the difference between that rate in
which it borrows money from you which is
the savings rate and the rate it then
charges to other people which is their
boring rate is the bank's profit so on
the whole it always costs more to borrow
than you can to earn by Saving which is
why you want to focus on paying off your
debt before you focus on saving for
example if you have a thousand dollars
of credit card debt at 22 interest that
is costing you 220 dollars in interest
every year now say instead of paying
that off you decide to save you save
that one thousand dollars in a high
interest account paying three percent
then you you're only 30 dollars in
interest over the year so you're
essentially 190 dollars worse off debts
usually cost more than savings ads the
sixth thing is a maintenance before
replacement the moment something looks a
bit outdated or it doesn't work as
efficiently we convince ourselves that
we need to get the new upgraded version
instead of first seeing if it can be
fixed or if a bit of Maintenance can
instead get the job done one of the ways
I make sure my Mac lasts as long as
possible and stays working as fast as it
did on day one is by using an app called
clean my Mac who are sponsoring this
video clean my Mac has millions of users
in 185 countries and is notarized by
Apple one of the app's most popular
features and my favorite is the Smart
scan this is a tool for Mac optimization
so it essentially does three jobs with
one button clean up protection and speed
up on all of these take a couple of
seconds the new feature of the app also
has a redesigned menu it's a little
dashboard with informative monitors
about every aspect of your performance
what's your battery temperature how much
space is left what's the speed of the
internet connection it tells you
everything it's also super user friendly
which is exactly what someone like me
needs if you do want to give it a go
before you pay for a new laptop
altogether then you can get a free
seven-day trial using the link in my bio
the seventh thing is avoid brand loyalty
except if it affects the utility this
point is especially relevant when it
comes to non-essential items and in
these cases the brand name often
represents a status symbol rather than
the actual value or benefit of it so
before I buy something that is more
expensive than the average price of that
product I asked myself what am I paying
the premium for is that for the
convenience is it for efficiency or is
it just for the perceived value of the
brand for example I'd rather spend fifty
dollars on a good quality jumper than
500 on the same quality jumper just
because it has a specific brand on it
because it still does what it's meant to
do but I will still Splurge out on a
MacBook because for me me I'm paying for
the ease and the use the editing
software the performers number eight
auto save how often have you said I'm
going to save 100 next month and then
next month comes around and you either
forgot you said that or you convince
yourself that you don't actually need to
and you rather spend it on something
else that you don't even need a way to
stop this from happening is by setting
up the right systems to make the process
of saving ultimately take care of itself
so I have my account set up so that at
the start of the month a portion of my
money is moved from my current account
to my long-term savings account and then
another portion to my investment account
and the reason I automate this is
because it removes any obstacles that
get in the way of saving money and
because all of this is happening in the
background of your life it's almost like
it was never even there in the first
place number nine is to remember the
phrase buy a want to cry once it's
better to invest in a high quality
product than buying a cheaper and lower
quality product that you'll need to
replace sooner and more often even
though the first option might seem more
expensive up front it can actually save
you more money in the long run and this
principle applies to almost everything
household appliances Furniture clothing
by investing in high quality items that
last longer you can avoid having to
replace them as frequently and
ultimately getting better value for your
money the 10th thing you can do is cut
back on your bills the vast majority of
people are overpaying on their bills
especially on things like their car
insurance and their phone bill price
comparison websites allow you to compare
the prices of different providers for a
particular service so you can quickly
see which providers are offering the
best deals and the prices and it can
help you decide whether you want to
switch providers and use one that's
cheaper or use that information to
negotiate a better deal with your
existing provider most providers will
offer discounts or other incentives to
keep your business so it's always worth
asking finally number 11 which is a bit
of a bonus Point here and that is to
Define your lifestyle if you take some
time to carve out what is important to
you what your big goals are and what
you're saving for it makes it so much
easier to ruthlessly cut costs
everywhere else people think that if all
you do is save you must be miserable and
you're forgetting to live your life to
the full but that is definitely not the
case living below your means and saving
for peace of mind or to invest isn't
about deprivation it's about
prioritization the whole point of this
is to give you optionality and choices
not the other way so it's about spending
on things that matter to you and really
cutting down on things that don't really
make a difference those are some of my
favorite tips if you have any others
that have worked for you I'd love to
hear what they are if you want more
ideas on things that I no longer buy
then I have a video on that which you
may also enjoy thank you so much for
watching don't forget to subscribe if
you haven't already and I hope to see
you in my next video"
0lQOWQfX3bo,"in this video I'm going to rate seven passive 
income ideas based on firstly how hard it is  
to get started and secondly how hard it is to 
maintain and make money from it so whether you're  
working a 95 and want some passive income on the 
side or you're looking to start a side hustle that  
are two main ways you can do this the first is by 
buying physical property and making money through  
rental income for this the barriers to entry are 
quite High you need money for a down payment you  
need a good credit score and then you need to 
Source the property and find a good tenant so  
in terms of getting started I'd give this a three 
out of five and in terms of Maintenance you can  
choose how passive you want this to be so if you 
want to manage your properties yourself it will  
cost you your time or if you want to hire someone 
or give it to a property manager to handle it will  
cost you money and so if that sounds like a lot 
of work the second way you can make money through  
rental income without actually needing a deposit 
or managing the property is through investing in a  
real estate investment trust a Reit is essentially 
a company that invests in different types of  
properties it could be hotels warehouses shopping 
centers and then it rents those properties out  
and from the rental income it receives it's 
legally required to pay 90 of that income to its  
shareholders in the form of dividends so in terms 
of getting started and investing in a read I give  
this one it's far easier to do and you could buy 
publicly traded REITs through a brokerage account  
like like you would any other stock and in terms 
of Maintenance and how much you can make I'd give  
this a two because you do not have the hassle of 
direct ownership but you do need to invest a fair  
amount of money to make a decent return because 
you're not relying on any leverage so for example  
segro which is a reach that invests in property 
around Europe is offering a 3.4 return so to be  
able to make the equivalent of around 140 a month 
you would need to invest fifty thousand dollars of  
your own money but because these REITs generally 
have long leases where the Brew chip tenants the  
rental income you can make is relatively more 
reliable in various market conditions number  
two is being a Creator printer this is being a 
content creator but I've called it createdpreneur  
to emphasize that to make this a passive income 
stream you need to think about content creation  
as an entrepreneur and this is a middle ground 
that isn't really tapped into so on one side you  
can love creating content but if you don't think 
of it as a business it's just a hobby whereas if  
you solely focus on the business side of it 
you're going to burn out before even making  
it into a passive income Stream So you want to 
tie both of these together for a platform like  
YouTube in terms of getting started anyone could 
do it you literally need a phone and an internet  
connection so I'm going to give this a one to get 
started the harder part and what makes this into a  
passive income stream is actually how long you can 
keep this up for without seeing the returns and  
this is where the entrepreneurial side comes in 
setting up the process hiring Outsourcing so that  
you can concentrate on producing quality content 
for as long as possible it took 10 months of  
making no money through YouTube for me to finally 
be eligible for the partnership program and now  
I make hundreds of the day from YouTube AdSense 
and most of that is passive because it's coming  
through my older videos another example is Ali 
who last year made 405 million from YouTube and  
he spends a couple of hours a week on it he also 
has a YouTube course on how he's built this up and  
the systems he's put around it are link it below 
if you are considering it and want to check it  
out but the hardest part of this income stream is 
putting in the time and staying consistent so I'm  
going to give this a four in terms of Maintenance 
but if you can get through that initial phase you  
can make a lot of money through YouTube and this 
is one of the best passive income streams in my  
opinion number three an online course I'm a big 
fan of this one because firstly as a consumer it  
gives you so much access to information that you 
wouldn't otherwise have and from a passive income  
point of view it's a great place to make scalable 
income an example of someone who has done really  
well from this is cat Norton who started a tick 
tock profile around tricks and tips of using Excel  
those videos blew up and evolved into her teaching 
others about Excel through online courses and in  
her first year from doing this full time she made 
one million dollars in sales from air and now on  
a good day she makes over six figures a day from 
her courses which are completely passive she made  
it once and now she sells it again and again 
so how hard is this to get started the real  
thing or the real difficulty here is to identify 
what value you can bring and what you can teach  
to other people that they're willing to pay for 
once you've got that bit figured out it's about  
creating the class and putting on a platform like 
skillshare or udemy which doesn't really require  
much in terms of Maintenance or you can host it 
on your own website and make sure you're driving  
traffic to it so in terms of Maintenance that's 
the easier part and I'm going to give that a two  
out of five the fourth way to make passive income 
and this is the truest form of passive income out  
there and that is through dividend investing 
the way to think about this is when you buy  
a share of a company you now own a little piece 
of that company and so if it's paying dividends  
that means they are taking part of their profits 
and giving you a percentage in terms of getting  
started I'll give this a three because buying 
individual stocks for the dividends requires a  
lot of research if you don't want to be spending 
a lot of time reading through all the financial  
statements and the accounts then a better way 
to make passive income through dividends is  
by invest testing in index funds this is the 
path that I take and it's a safer way to earn  
dividends than only individual stocks because 
you're diversifying what you have exposure  
to so instead of being focused on one company 
and its dividends you now have pieces of lots  
of different companies that will pay dividends 
in terms of getting started I'll give this one  
it's really easy to do set up a brokerage account 
invest in index funds but in terms of Maintenance  
and making a lot of money through this I'll give 
it a three because although you don't really need  
to do anything with your Investments if it's 
an index fund to really reap the benefits you  
do need to keep investing and also reinvest the 
dividends to buy more shares of those index funds  
and then the real passive income will be through 
the appreciation and the capital gain side of it  
the fifth way to make passive income is through 
selling digital products so this includes ebooks  
downloadables presets website themes what I really 
like about digital products is that it takes time  
to create them but the costs are so low and it's 
pretty much passive thereafter so one example of  
someone who has done really well from the S is 
Steve shoga who has packaged up all the knowledge  
he had learned through his day job about design 
tips and bundled it up in an e-book and according  
to an article online he made a 2.3 million dollars 
from it we all think we have to create something  
revolutionary to make a lot of money but that idea 
may just come from what we do day to day most of  
us go to job daily as an expert in our field but 
never think to turn what we know into an ebook and  
that's exactly what he did in terms of starting 
I'd give this a two you really don't need any  
money to get started but the harder part again 
is actually coming up with the idea that people  
will pay for and in terms of Maintenance and being 
able to make money from it I'm going to give this  
a three out of five because you can either put it 
on sites like Etsy and people can search for it  
or you could spend more time creating an audience 
and creating content and use that to boost your  
sales even further but the most important thing 
is being able to provide something valuable that  
people are willing to pay for the sixth passive 
income method is affiliate marketing so this is  
when you promote someone else's goods or services 
and get a commission or a small percentage for  
doing so so for example if you see the links in 
my description those are affiliate links and so I  
get a percentage of that sale and it doesn't cost 
you any more money for buying that product through  
the link according to an article online the 
national average amount an affiliate makes is 55  
000 per year and for me through that and YouTube 
AdSense combined in the last week I made nineteen  
thousand dollars so how easy is it anyone can 
sign up and join the affiliate program that takes  
literally five minutes so I'm going to give that a 
one in terms of getting started but the hard part  
here is actually driving traffic so whilst I say 
I made x amount in a week actually it took me a  
year to build a platform and build an audience to 
get me in a place where I can make that passively  
and so the affiliate side is almost a byproduct of 
the amount of work that you'd put in to grow that  
audience in the first place and so to really scale 
and make this passive you do need a lot of traffic  
so you can put it on your social media website 
your blog your Twitter and the amount you make  
from it is really dependent on how much you're 
putting it up front to grow those Avenues so  
with that said in terms of Maintenance I'm going 
to give it a four because it is a lot of work  
to keep that traffic coming through organically 
finally idea number seven of this passive income  
stream video is productized service this is a 
hybrid between a product and a service making  
money through a service is one of the easiest ways 
to make money like editing videos or one-to-one  
coaching but these are limited they're capped 
because it requires you to trade time for money  
so it's hard to scale there's only one of you 
so a productized service then is turning that  
service into a product and you're automating 
the process so that you can eventually take  
yourself out of the equation and that income can 
be made passive so for example one of my friends  
is a personal trainer and she used to before the 
pandemic do one-to-one classes and charged by the  
hour then she built it into a product High service 
so she offers subscribers 30 workouts per month  
for 18 per month and she has about 4 000 people 
that are subscribed and she's making monthly  
income from that so she has ultimately made a 
package service she's built an app she started  
a subscription service and hired a team of people 
so she spent a lot of time building this up which  
is why I'll give this a four in terms of getting 
started it's not easy but now she has other people  
that have stepped in and run the day-to-day so 
other personal trainers who record the workouts  
and upload them or the marketing and she basically 
oversees it all but it requires the skill set to  
be able to get there and make sure that value 
is consistently being provided which isn't  
simple to do and so even on the maintenance Side 
and being able to consistently make money from  
this I would give this a four out of five so those 
are some passive income streams to give you some  
ideas if you have done any of these already I'm 
curious to know what your experience was will  
there and if you'd recommend it yourself or if 
you have other passive income streams that have  
really worked for you I'd love to hear about 
it if you did enjoy this video you may also  
enjoy another video that I have and I'll link 
it up here and there on things that I no longer  
buy even though I have built up my passive 
income streams and I hope to see you there"
auoPb5rwm0Y,"three months ago just after hitting 1 000 
subscribers I made a video on how I will become  
a millionaire by 32. little did I know at the time 
that that video was going to get 1 million views  
and I was going to reach 400 000 subscribers 
three months later at the back of that video I  
read a few other comments with some people being 
like well that's all well and good but how you  
actually applying what you're saying so as I open 
this thing I thought it'll be interesting to go  
through how I have applied each of those points 
since then and how it's got me closer to where  
I want to be a bit of a disclaimer what I really 
meant was how I plan to be financially free by 32  
but that doesn't have the same ring to it anyway 
let's get into it number one was my all-weather  
portfolio the first thing I said I was focusing on 
is my all-weather portfolio which is essentially  
building out my income streams to withstand the 
different curveballs life throws so this time last  
year I had two income streams and that was firstly 
through my day job as a banker and secondly  
through rental property and in the last 12 months 
I was committed to building those out both online  
and offline I've explored a million and one 
different things since then some of them went  
well and some of them I completely failed at what 
I've learned through it all is if you say you're  
going to do something show up commit to what you 
said you're going to do and if it's not going well  
fail fast fell forward and learn quickly if 
it doesn't work you could just move on to the  
next thing and take those learnings with you you 
YouTube is now one of my income streams more so  
than I ever expected it to be and that's why this 
represents part of my journey to Financial Freedom  
if each of your subscribers were alight yeah 
they would take you from one side of the Milky  
Way to the other that's cool the second thing 
I said is thinking in terms of first principles  
and this concept came from Elon Musk and what he 
essentially meant is not to take everything at  
face value and just because something hasn't been 
done before it does not mean it's not possible and  
you cannot prove a negative unlike a corporate 
job where you have a pretty much known trodden  
path to follow you go to school you get good 
grades get a degree apply for a job being an  
entrepreneur requires a lot of first principles 
thinking where you really don't know whether  
or not the thing you are working on is the next 
million dollar idea or an absolute fail but to get  
to that point you have to be willing to do things 
that the ordinary person thinks is impossible and  
what I've realized in the last couple of months is 
no matter how big or unreachable what you want to  
do seems you first need to have the belief and the 
growth mindset that can be done and then you need  
to break it down into smaller steps to realize 
how obtainable each of those steps are because  
pretty much everything today can be figured out 
somehow through books through courses through the  
internet speaking to other people so the next 
time someone tells you your goal is too big or  
tells you something is not possible or you're too 
old for it walk away break it into smaller plans  
and just get working on it let's take this off 
the third thing I said I'll be doing is utilizing  
the strengths of others and this has been a game 
changer for me in the book The e-myth Revisited  
the author discusses the reasoning as to why most 
businesses fail and he argues that one of the main  
reasons is that people focus in the business and 
in the technicalities rather than on the business  
as a whole none of us are good at everything we 
all have individual strengths that are unique to  
us and what I've realized is those unique skills 
will get you to a certain point but then to get  
even further you need to utilize the strengths of 
others for example I know I am not very good with  
technology I will openly say it I'm not going 
to pretend that I am or try to convince myself  
that I am but somehow I've managed to make my 
Youtube setup look somewhat decent I've fixed  
my audio I've got a website up and running and 
I've managed to make a living through what is  
essentially technology but I can tell you now 
that this was only possible because I utilized  
these strengths of others I paid for the strengths 
and the skills of other people who are better than  
me in these areas whilst I focused on what I was 
good at and adding value there the fourth thing I  
mentioned was the slight Edge this concept came 
from the book The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson and  
he mentions that our small habits and actions 
that we take every day will ultimately decide  
where we get to in life and whether we will 
fail or succeed it may not feel like we're  
sacrificing much if you don't work out today or 
if you don't work out tomorrow or the day after  
but as you keep missing your workouts those small 
habits will catch up with you five years from now  
and you'll be in a whole different place than you 
would if you committed to showing up every day and  
if I look back at the last five years of my life 
I can say the same thing the first four of those  
five years nothing really happened I just coasted 
I stayed in the same job did the same things and  
my life pretty much looked exactly the same in 
year one as it did in year four and then at the  
start of last year I committed to changing things 
up for myself and implemented these small habits  
every single day I meditated it first thing in 
the morning I wrote in my journal every day I  
spent three hours no matter what every day on a 
side hustle and I've started to see the benefits  
and the payoffs from these small actions and 
it was small repeated steps every day that I  
do believe will eventually pay off the fifth thing 
is leaning into your money making superpower when  
I recorded that video I truly believed everyone 
had a money making superpower I didn't know what  
mine was at the time but I knew that I had one and 
just through trying out so many different things  
as possible and absorbing as much information as 
I can I've started to figure out what mine is and  
I continue to believe everyone has one I've heard 
a few other creators speaking about this that your  
money making stream is a combination of working 
hard a bit of luck and your unfair advantages  
so things that you have that other people can't 
easily replicate so it may mean that you're able  
to take really complicated stuff and explain 
it in simple terms it may mean that you have  
a degree in maths or Pharmacy engineering all 
that you're a real people's person and amazing  
at sales and I think for me on social media one 
of my unfair advantages was the fact that I'm a  
qualified accountant and I've been working 
in investment banking for nine years but I  
do believe everyone has something like this that 
applies to them so lean into that thing because it  
will give you a head start and through that you'll 
be able to create your money making stream that's  
an extension of who you are and where your core 
strengths are the sixth thing I said I'll do is  
live below I means and this is one that is common 
sense but not common practice and it's essentially  
rule number one for managing your finances you 
want to increase the gap between your income and  
expenses as much as you can and then diversify and 
invest a difference and my income has increased  
since I made that video but my expenses have 
stayed exactly the same I've made no change in  
my lifestyle I don't plan on making changes 
maybe I'll buy my strawberries from the m s  
every now and then but other than that I will keep 
reinvesting the difference in a way that builds  
out my passive income stream and hopefully gets 
me to a point where I only work because I want  
to not because I need it to make money or because 
I have to with that said Thank You For This it's  
so cool the number of followers and subscribers 
has never meant much to me but what means a lot  
to me are the comments it's just seeing in black 
and white the impact that this channel has that  
means everything to me and I'm so glad that going 
down this path of achieving Financial Freedom I'm  
able to do the one thing that was so important 
to me and that was giving back along the way  
and helping the most number of people with the 
resources I have so I want to say thank you for  
watching I'm so happy to be part of your journey 
if you do want to check out that video that I've  
been banging on about then I'll link that here 
for you um I hope to see you in my next video"
ckGrqTXLwb0,"the way you manage your finances as you enter your 
30s has a ripple effect on the rest of your life  
so in this video I thought it'd be interesting 
to share with you six financial goals that will  
help set you up for the future if you're new 
here I'm Nisha I'm a qualified accountant and  
on this channel we discuss all things personal 
finance self-development and business before we  
get started I've had a lot of people asking 
about my budget tracker and when it's coming  
back I've finally revamped it and it's available 
again for free using the link in my bio with that  
side let's get into it the first goal you want to 
focus on is career capital and this is ultimately  
your foundation your stepping stone for building 
everything else in the book be so good they can't  
ignore you by Cal Newport Newport defines career 
Capital as skills you have that are both rare and  
valuable and that these can be used as leverage 
in defining your career so whilst your 20s is all  
about exploring and trying new things failing fast 
failing forward your 30s is about really doubling  
down what you enjoy and what can give you them 
most leverage in terms of pay and reward a lot  
of people focus on passive income and trying to 
grow their passive income straight away and yeah  
that is important to get the full rolling but 
I actually believe that active income is more  
important when you're just starting out and the 
reason for that is because active income at the  
start is your primary wealth building tool and 
the money you make from it is essentially going  
to dictate how quickly you can grow your other 
income streams for example if I'm able to invest  
fifty dollars and my portfolio returns 20 then I 
would have made ten dollars but if I'm investing  
two hundred dollars my portfolio only needs 
to go 10 and I still would have made more I  
would have made twenty dollars so putting more 
emphasis on earnings potential and increasing  
your active income your primary source will 
have a multiplier effect because you can also  
use that money towards other streams in 
a way that makes the other streams more  
passive as well so my first priority was to see 
how much I can max out my salary through my day  
job really pushing for the pay Rises pushing for 
the promotions and then that income and managing  
my finances has then allowed me to spend more on 
other streams where I've seen the growth has been  
a lot quicker because I'm investing more money 
into it to Outsource it and to get things done  
so your 30s is really about finding your Niche 
positioning yourself for the most rewarding jobs  
so that you can use it to build out other options 
number two build a mortality fund this needs to  
be liquid cash in a high interest savings account 
not locked up anywhere just easily accessible when  
you get into your 30s a lot of responsibilities 
come all at once you may have kids you may have  
a mortgage you have other bills to keep on WE 
generally don't have as much flexibility and  
options as we did in our early 20s and so if 
something happens whether it's a health care  
a job loss or something unexpected the last 
thing you want is the additional Financial  
stress of not having enough money to pay for it so 
I personally keep six months of my living expenses  
in my emergency fund at any one time and I never 
ever touch her I leave in a separate account a  
high interest savings account so I'm at least 
earning interest whilst it's sitting there and  
I keep an account which I don't even see because 
I don't want to remind myself that that money is  
readily available it's just there to give me some 
mental peace that if anything happens I always  
have that to fall back on if I really needed it 
so I have six months of a buffer the recommended  
amount is three to six months and if you're 
self-employed it's six to twelve months next  
we have what gets measured gets managed people 
who are good with their finances and managing  
their money measure their money I.E by clearly 
knowing what their long-term saving goals are and  
how they are working towards them you just drift 
aimlessly with no clear motive on how much you  
want to save or spend you are going to get swept 
away with marketing messages and everything else  
that's telling you what you should be spending 
your money on and you'll find it very hard to  
save up for anything substantial so I go through 
my personal finance tracker every three months  
I sit down with all my bills all my debit cards 
all my credit cards and I consolidate everything  
into my personal finance tracker so I have a clear 
idea of all my earnings and my outgoings and I get  
a snapshot essentially of how I am doing at any 
given time this has really worked for me because  
it's only every three months it doesn't take up 
a lot of my time I have added in more categories  
into my ones that anyone can use it that's the 
one that I've linked below but you can use any  
tracker that works for you and it'll just give 
you a really clear idea on where most of your  
money is going and then how you can cut back 
in areas that aren't as important to you just  
to make sure you're not going off track from your 
overall saving goals number four putting your eggs  
in different baskets we spoke at the start about 
increasing your active income but that's one part  
of it the other part is having an income stream 
portfolio that can withstand different situations  
because if you only have one stream you're in a 
risky position right now I have five or six ways  
that I'm making money both online and offline and 
there have been times where one of them has taken  
a hit but I've been okay because I have another 
one coming through for example one of my income  
streams is through properties but that stream 
has taken a hit because of what's going on in  
The Wider market and the interest rates but it 
hasn't impacted me because I have other streams  
coming through and making more money so what I'm 
trying to say is don't stop at one no matter how  
secure you think that stream is even working for 
a corporation we are taught that a job is secure  
and the non-risky path but all it takes is one 
person in the company somewhere along the ladder  
to make a decision and that's it your whole income 
and your whole livelihood changes I've seen this  
happen to so many people around me and so I will 
continuously say on this channel to not stop at  
your corporate job and not to trust that someone 
else or a company will take care of you just  
because you've been loyal to them you really want 
to give yourself optionality by preparing yourself  
for different circumstances and diversifying the 
way you make money the next thing you want to  
focus on is making money your laborers and this 
is arguably the most important one on the list  
if you're focusing on building true wealth it's 
an extension to the previous point but it's more  
important for the future than for diversifying 
your rest right now because what you do with  
your money now will dictate how you're going to 
live in 10 15 20 years time if you keep earning  
and saving at all and leaving in a bank account 
then by the time time you retire your savings will  
start getting exhausted pretty quickly however 
if you choose to start investing that money then  
that money will keep working for you it will 
keep working for you even when you're not even  
if you do decide to take some time out or retire 
you can sustain your lifestyle without worrying  
about running out of cash so you can invest in 
different ways you can invest in real estate in  
gold and precious metals and Fine Art in index 
funds ETFs I personally invest on all of these  
and that brings me to the sponsor of today's video 
which is one of the investment platforms that I've  
been using and that is trading 212. it lets you 
invest commission free into individual stocks and  
ETFs and they also have something called 
a price feature where you can see other  
people's portfolios and the pies they've created 
and which ones the most popular ones are and you  
can also create your own portfolio so I set up 
an automatic investment a certain amount comes  
out of my bank account every month straight away 
and gets invested into a diversified portfolio so  
you can tailor this portfolio to whatever your 
financial goals are for example you can invest  
part of your portfolio into something like SMP 500 
and then part of it into the Vanguard all World  
index funds whatever aligns to your risk strategy 
if you do want to check it out you can download  
the trading 212 app and if you use the promo 
code Nisha n-i-s-c-h-a and verify your account  
you will also get a free share that's worth up to 
100 pounds that brings me to my sixth Financial  
goal and that is paying off your credit card and 
Consumer Debt when you start looking at debt as  
a normal way of living you start inviting the 
concept of Lifestyle creep into your life we've  
become a debt written nation and having some form 
of debt has become the standard but in your 30s  
especially you want to focus on paying down any 
credit card or Consumer Debt that you have people  
have different views on debt and my personal view 
is to stay away from it unless you're using that  
debt as leverage and you know that the returns 
will outweigh the cost of it if you're not doing  
that then paying off credit cards and Consumer 
Debt especially is a wise idea I want to emphasize  
here that although I've said these are things 
you want to achieve in your 30s that's because  
I I myself I'm going into my 30s and so these 
are things that I'm doing and I'm focusing on  
but in reality it doesn't need to fit everyone's 
timeline I believe a lot of us compare ourselves  
to others when it comes to defining success and 
that is The Benchmark and whilst occasionally  
this can serve as a motivational factor it's 
never really done fairly because no one begins  
the race at the same starting line and that's 
why I haven't mentioned specific numbered goals  
in this video I've just spoken about trajectory 
never too late to get started so hopefully this  
gives you some tips and guidance and things to 
consider whatever point in the journey you're  
at without I will leave you with another video 
that you might also enjoy and that is my sixth  
favorite personal finance books that I've had the 
biggest impact in my life thank you so much for  
watching don't forget to subscribe if you haven't 
already and I hope to see you in my next video"
Df0vq2jz5Ws,"the question of whether you should buy a finance 
or lease a car is surprisingly controversial on  
one side you're making that buying a car is 
the best option because it means you get full  
ownership of the car and it works out cheaper in 
the long run but on the other side you may think  
that leasing is a good idea because it means 
you pay far less on a monthly basis and you  
get to drive around a brand new car after doing 
a thorough analysis and running the numbers on  
all the various options I was pretty surprised 
at what I found and the difference in savings  
between going for what a car dealership tries to 
sell you and what is actually the cheapest option  
so in this video we're going to cover four of the 
main ways to purchase the car what they are which  
one's the cheapest and finally the psychological 
factors to take into consideration this is part  
of a series of accountant explains videos where we 
discuss all things personal finance and Building  
Wealth part one what are the main options the 
first way to purchase a car is just by buying  
it outright pay the full price of the car on day 
one and you don't have to worry about any payments  
or interest going forward pretty straightforward 
the second way to buy a car is through finance and  
in the UK this is often referred to as higher 
purchase and it works in a similar way to a  
personal loan so you pay a deposit towards the 
car you borrow the outstanding amount at a set  
interest rate for an agreed period let's say 
three years and then over the three years you  
make monthly repayments and then at the end of 
that period you own the car the Third Way is to  
release which is essentially like renting you make 
monthly payments to use the car and at the end  
of the contract you give the car back the monthly 
payments here are calculated slightly differently  
than in the finance option in the finance higher 
purchase option you are paying off the full value  
of the car because you're going to own the car at 
the end in the lease option you are only repaying  
part of the car and that's the part that the car 
depreciates during the time you have it for you  
then divide that amount into monthly payments and 
add some fees on top the fourth option is PCP and  
for this you set a term for the agreement you pay 
a deposit and then the company provides a final  
value for their car and what it will be worth at 
the end of the agreement these are then subtracted  
from the cost of the car to work out how much the 
loan will be and how much you'll be paying on a  
monthly basis at the end of the contract you have 
a few options for the PCP you can decide whether  
you want to keep the car and pay that final value 
you can choose whether you want to return the car  
or you can use that final value to part exchange 
the car now we've covered the foundations let's  
go into the financial implications and the cost 
of each of these so to compare apples with apples  
I've done this analysis using an average 
medium-sized family car so that is the Audi  
of these options I'm using a 15 deposit so 4500 
pounds and a three year term to make it as like  
for like as possible the first financing option 
we discussed is the higher purchase so I put down  
a deposit the interest rate I was quoted was 
just under 11 which brings my monthly payments  
for a three-year term to 810 pounds a month that 
means the total price I pay for the car at the end  
of the contract is just under 34 000 and at this 
point I now have full ownership of the car let's  
assume now I want to sell the car I'm going to say 
looking at comparables on the market I can get 16  
000 pounds per eye online on the second hand 
car market this car three years old is going  
for a fair bit higher than this twenty thousand 
pounds plus but I don't think this is an accurate  
representation of what we can get for the car in 
three years time because secondhand car prices are  
going through the roof at the moment and I don't 
believe this will continue for the next three  
years I think this bubble will burst before then 
so if I were to sell the car for that much then  
it would have essentially cost me around 17 500 to 
have the car for three years the next way we spoke  
about is buying a car through a lease in the lease 
option assuming I put down the same deposit the  
monthly payments are 345 pounds a month far lower 
than the finance higher purchase option because of  
the way we say it's calculated only on a portion 
of the car and it's no interest so in this case to  
have the car for three years it would have cost 
me around 17 000 pounds sometimes you have the  
option to buy that car at the end of the term but 
this isn't guaranteed and you won't know how much  
the dealership is actually going to give you for 
that car until the last few months of the lease  
term unlike the next option which is the PCP this 
is the most popular one the one that most people  
take up and one of the reasons for this is because 
the car dealership pushes you to take this one on  
because it is also the most lucrative for the them 
but it definitely may not be the best option for  
you if you are just looking at it in terms of 
a total cost perspective let's run through the  
numbers putting down the same deposit the value 
they said this car will be worth in 3s time is 15  
000 So based on my deposit the pre-agreed 
car value of 15 000 and interest rate again  
of just under 11 my monthly payment would be 453 
pounds if at the end of the contract I decide to  
return the car then to have that car for three 
years it would have cost me approximately 21  
000 and if I were at that point to instead choose 
to keep the car and pay the final balance of 15  
000 it would have cost me 36 000 pounds the total 
cost of the car from those numbers on this car you  
can see if I went for the PCP option at the end 
of the contract if I returned the car then I would  
have been better off just going with the leasing 
option it would have saved me four thousand pounds  
nearly the car dealership tries to sell you the 
PCP because it is the most lucrative for them they  
make the most money from it because it encourages 
you to stay with them and when the contract ends  
to upgrade your car and part exchange it so they 
keep making money from you they would also try and  
tweak the numbers using dealer contributions or 
changing the deposit slightly to try and encourage  
you to go for the PCP option in some cases it 
may well be the best option for you it may work  
out better because you're getting a car that holds 
its value and you or you want more flexibility but  
it's also important to do the calculation looking 
at the total cost of the car as a whole and just  
to further drive this point home no pun intended 
if I decide to keep the car at the end of the  
contract I would have been better going for the 
higher purchase option that would have also saved  
me money the other option which we spoke about 
is buying the car outright for thirty thousand  
if we did this and assuming we could sell it at 
16 000 that price in the second hand market then  
this would be the cheapest option at 14 000 to 
have the car for three years however an important  
something to consider here is the opportunity 
cost if you put 30 000 in day one it's locked  
up in the car the alternative is if you have 
thirty thousand and you paid the four thousand  
five hundred deposit and then you have the left 
over to invest in something like the S P 500 or  
another cash generating asset the question here 
is can you make a better return on that versus  
the additional cost of a financing option other 
factors to consider are the psychological factors  
if you are someone who tends to keep your cars for 
a long time then going down the higher purchase  
route means you can pay your car off and then you 
won't have the stress of having to keep up with  
your monthly payments and you have full ownership 
of the car which means you can do what you want  
to it you could drive it as far as you want but 
at the same time any maintenance costs do fall on  
you and this cost tends to rack up the longer 
you have a car for on the flip side going for  
the lease or the PCP option means you can go for a 
newer car with lower monthly payments and you can  
keep changing your car more regularly whilst not 
worrying about whether you'll be able to sell the  
car in the future and for how much you also in 
this case don't have to worry about the ongoing  
maintenance if you keep trading in the cars before 
the warranty runs out which is usually around the  
three year mark however you do need to keep the 
car in pristine condition otherwise you'll get  
charged a bump for it when you return it and there 
are restrictions also when it comes to the PCP or  
lease so that includes the changes you can make 
to the car and also the number of miles you do on  
it if you go over that mile restriction then you 
will incur an additional cost per mile if you do  
have the money to buy a car outright then this in 
my opinion is a solid option where you don't have  
the stress of any monthly payments if you were to 
go down this option unless you really know when it  
comes to cars and you can flip it on for a profit 
then instead buying a pre-owned car that's two to  
three years old and has already depreciated 
substantially at someone else's expense might  
well be the best option so hopefully this video 
gave you some ideas on things to consider and how  
to run the numbers for yourself and which route 
you want to go down this analysis has been done  
on the basis that you are buying a car as an 
individual rather than as a company or through  
a business if you've got value from this video 
please do share it the importance of financial  
education and financial literacy is so important 
I'd also love to know how you've bought your car  
how you bought the one that you currently 
drive if you do have a car or how you're  
thinking about purchasing your next car thank 
you for watching and see you in my next video"
wfe3abSd3GM,"over the last few decades companies have learned 
how to deploy forms of Mind Control in order to  
encourage you to spend money on things you don't 
actually need so in this video I'm going to share  
with you five mind tags you can use to rewire the 
way you think about spending which will hopefully  
mean you have more money left over every month 
to invest and to get you on a path to building  
Financial Freedom number one ignore pay Rises you 
may be familiar with Parkinson's law and that is  
the principle that demand will expand to consume 
all available resources so if you had five weeks  
to complete a project you'll take up five weeks 
to do it you'll have a few breaks you'll be pretty  
inefficient but you'll take up the full five weeks 
whereas if you gave yourself five days to do it  
you'd be super focused super efficient and you 
still get it done so work expands to consume all  
available time and you can use the same concept 
when it comes to money your spending will expand  
to consume all available money so whether you're 
earning 50 000 or 100 000 and your expenses will  
keep increasing to consume all available money 
but the amount of money we make doesn't need  
to equate to the amount we're spending so 
if you're earning 60 000 a year and you're  
comfortably making ends meet you're not struggling 
and then you get a pay rise and it increases to 80  
000 most people at this stage are going to think 
okay I have another 20 000 another extra 20 000 to  
upsize my lifestyle but you need to pay yourself 
first let that difference or the majority of that  
difference be the amount you put into your 
savings account straight away from day one  
as soon as it comes in I read a comment on one of 
my previous videos and I really liked the way it  
was explained and I'll leave a screenshot on this 
video but the idea is to think about what you can  
comfortably afford and then buy things that are 
at a lower price point so if your mortgage allows  
you to borrow five thousand pounds a month don't 
then go and buy a house with a mortgage is five  
thousand a month buy one which is three thousand 
or four thousand so that you have the mental ease  
and you're not stretching yourself thin if you 
do this you're still going going to be fine you  
will still exist you will just reap the rewards 
in the future number two thinking in terms of  
hours worked the most valuable currency we all 
have in our lives is time nothing can replace  
that there is no amount of time that you can 
buy and you will never get it back so when I  
had income coming in through just my corporate job 
I used to think of my spending in terms of hours  
worked so how many hours do I need to work post 
tax not pre-tax to be able to afford that thing  
and thinking like this made me not waste my money 
on things that I will regret later because for me  
and I'm not saying this is the same for everyone 
but for me I like to spend my hard earned time  
on anything that is related to financial Freedom 
mental or physical health or thirdly on education  
and learning in some way others may want to spend 
their hard-earned time on other things it might be  
fashion it might be because it might be watches 
whatever it is check in with your priorities and  
what is important to you and whether whatever 
you're spending on deserves those hours that  
you worked for it or whether it's better spent 
somewhere else that would give you a better return  
on happiness versus time spent number three add 
an emotional response to not buying it we often  
have emotional attachments to items that we want 
to buy but what I've started to doing recently is  
adding an emotional response to why I want to save 
and for me it's made living below my means so much  
easier because it's attached to a bigger picture 
and a wider meaning what I used to do every year  
when my bonus came through is spend that paycheck 
straight on a new item a designer bag a designer  
belt something to escape the monotony of life 
every now and again and to justify to myself  
why I'm working so hard on something that doesn't 
necessarily fulfill me and in the first few years  
of work I got so excited about the extra money and 
all the things I could potentially spend on now I  
still have that emotional response of excitement 
but the excitement is how I can use that money to  
get me closer to the things that I want which 
is Financial Freedom working on my own terms  
traveling as much as I want that is what excites 
me now and having an emotional attachment to that  
makes living below my means so much easier I 
often hear people say that if you're chasing  
Financial Freedom or if you're focused on saving 
too much you're going to miss out on living your  
life in the here and now and I personally don't 
think it needs to be one or the other I used to  
live paycheck to paycheck and spend all my money 
on things that I didn't need and fast forward five  
years even though I'm spending way less I'm 
way happier than I was five years ago so you  
can still very much enjoy your life whilst living 
below your means and for some people that mental  
peace and feeling of accomplishment whatever it 
is may actually be their way of living life to  
the fullest there's this quote that I heard and 
it's used the weekend to build a life that you  
want not to escape the life that you have and 
now I view money in a similar way for me that  
emotional attachment to not splurging out today 
for my future self makes me happier overrides  
any temptations that I have number four sleep 
on it for seven days so much of our spending  
is based on impulse purchases the way marketing 
companies work at the moment is to satisfy our  
need for instant gratification there's Apple 
pay there's Amazon Prime click one click buy  
there's contactless purchases it makes spending 
mindlessly so much easier and as a society we  
demand instant gratification and that is what has 
been created around us the problem is if you fall  
into the Temptations of of instant gratification 
this can very easily deplete all your savings  
marketing companies they have specific teams and 
huge budgets that are dedicated to getting you to  
buy and the amount of detail that goes into this 
is Way Beyond what you and I can even comprehend  
these companies track everything what emails 
made you buy what emails didn't make you buy  
what emails were most successful in terms of 
sales and based on that you'll get a similar  
email next time there are so many details that 
go into trying to make you shop so now I've made  
a rule that if I want to spend more than usual 
on something and I've never thought about buying  
that thing before then I would give myself seven 
days before I actually commit to buying it and  
then after that seven days either I've forgotten 
about it which is great I obviously didn't want  
it that bad or I still think about it and in that 
case I will actually go ahead and buy it so just  
by giving yourself some time and space to think 
rationally could save on unnecessarily spending  
and splurges number five listen to The Narrative 
you are feeding yourself the fifth mind hack to  
save more money is to eliminate Temptations and 
be more conscious around the messages and the  
signals that you are feeding into your mind on 
a daily basis the rise of social media makes it  
so much easier for us to compare lives with what 
we're seeing online comparing Our Lives to what  
everyone else is up to where they're going what 
they're eating and all of this it just feeds into  
the fear of missing out culture so it's important 
to be mindful of whether spending on that thing is  
actually what you want and it fits into your 
narrative or it's just a excuse or a part of  
trying to fit into the social Norm Take Back 
Control over what you're feeding your mind the  
profiles you're choosing to follow the Articles 
you're choosing to read the friends you keep close  
to you believe it or not all of that is in your 
control it takes a little bit of willpower but  
it is fully in your control I want to emphasize 
that everything I say on this channel is just  
what works for me and what I'm doing some people 
might find spending money on new designer bags  
that makes them happy some people might find 
spending money on traveling makes them happy  
some people might find saving money and doing 
nothing with it gives them peace of mind and  
in turn makes them happy this is just my journey 
and what makes me happy and I am speaking about  
the changes I'm making to build a certain life for 
myself and for the future without compromising on  
the here and now maybe it'll pay off in the long 
run maybe it won't but that's what this channel is  
for to take you on my journey whatever happens 
so you can see my way of thinking my thought  
process on why I'm doing certain things a 
certain way why I'm not doing other things  
and everything is openly said on this channel and 
it's for you to take bits of information that you  
agree with and leave anything else that you don't 
like behind if you are on a saving Marathon then  
you may also enjoy another video that I have 
on things I no longer buy and I've cut out my  
life and it hasn't made any difference to my life 
I'll link that here for you thank you so much for  
watching don't forget to subscribe if you haven't 
already and I hope to see you in my next video"
TcupxVH3iI8,"even though I'm making more money than I have ever 
made before my personal spending is probably the  
lowest it has ever been and one of the reasons 
for that is because I'm focusing more and more on  
things that genuinely matter to me and that means 
that at this stage in my life if it's not making  
me happier it's not making me healthier or it 
isn't getting me any closer to my financial goals  
then I am not buying into it so in today's video 
I'm going to share with you some of my favorite  
purchases that have had the biggest impact to 
my life in these three categories first on my  
list is my atrosty journal slash planner I started 
journaling way back way way back and I can't quite  
explain how much writing things down and having 
a journal has impacted my life it's made me more  
mindful more focused and more intentional with 
what I do and there is so much evidence to show  
how powerful journaling and self-analysis can 
be for your development I use my journal in two  
ways firstly as a self-analysis tool I log down 
on my experiences my insights my ideas whenever  
ever it comes to my mind and secondly I use that 
as a weekly planner to have a clear focus on my  
top priorities and my non-negotiables every week 
the second thing on this list is a specific book  
and it's the Midnight Library by Matt Hague Matt 
Hague he's written so many books he is the most  
productive person ever but this one specifically 
is my favorite it's a super good book for anyone  
who needs to pick me up and is going through a 
challenging time it's basically a self-help book  
and motivational book but disguised as fiction 
the midnight library takes you through a journey  
with a woman who gets to the end of her life and 
she finds herself in this Library where each book  
represents a different life that she could have 
lived had she made a slightly different decision  
at a point in her life the character Nora she dips 
in and out of all of these books and you follow  
her into her journey seeing these different lives 
and it reminds you of the joys found in living and  
that no life is perfect in itself next on my list 
which is probably to no surprise to anyone who has  
watched a few of my YouTube videos and it's this 
blacktop and I love it so much that I have two of  
the exact same ones it's just the Classic black 
top so why do I love it so much other than it  
being incredibly comfortable and Incredibly 
warm well it's made my life so much easier  
when it comes to recording YouTube videos as it's 
just one less decision that I have to make and I  
apply this concept in so many areas of my life 
I try to limit the amount of decisions I need  
to get something done and I think that this is 
such an important part of being able to stay  
consistent when it comes to YouTube I don't have 
all the time to just spend recording videos so I  
create my environment in a way that makes it 
a no-brainer for me to take action so I have  
my camera set up I have my tripod set up I have my 
light set up it doesn't move a big part of staying  
consistent is to remove as many restrictions and 
objections in doing the tasks that I need to do  
so this has been a massive help in me staying 
consistent on YouTube the fourth thing on my  
list is outsourcing this isn't a specific item 
but it's just something that I'm spending more  
and more money on these days and it gives me back 
time it gives me back energy and it gives me about  
brain power if you watch my other videos you know 
I talk about the dollar value of my time and it's  
something that I've implemented in the last two 
years after reading the book The Almanac by Naval  
ravicent he says we should set an aspirational 
hourly rate on our time and then anything that I  
can Outsource for less than that hourly rate I try 
and Outsource that so for me this really applies  
to household stuff like assembling furniture 
cleaning the amount of high mental energy we  
have in a day is scarce so I personally try and 
spend it doing the big tick items that will make  
the most difference to my life and then any free 
time that I have I just use it to chill next on  
my list is another one of my favorite purchases 
and it is something that's freed me up so much  
time without breaking my bank account and with 
that I want to introduce the sponsor of today's  
video who I am so excited to be working with 
because I have been consuming their products  
for a while now and that is fuel over the past few 
months I have become very very reliant on huel and  
more specifically their essential meal and even 
more specifically their chocolate flavored one  
I'm trying to juggle a lot of different things 
recently and this has been one of the reasons  
I've been able to get all my proteins get all my 
vitamins get all my minerals that I need into my  
diet without sacrificing on my productivity is 
super quick you add 500 milliliters of water  
to the Shaker you add two scoops of this 100 
plant-based essential powder you give it a good  
Shake 10 seconds recommended and you're good 
to go there's no time spent in thinking okay  
what am I going to make today how am I going to 
get my vitamins and proteins into the meal oh I  
need to clean up now all of that just disappears 
it's just one less thing to worry about and it's  
also really affordable one of these meals equates 
to one pound and if you do like it and if you do  
want to consider it but then by using the link 
in my description below you'll also get a free  
Shaker next on my list is fast tech I don't 
really believe in upgrading stuff just so I  
could have the latest version I have the iPhone 
10 up until four months ago but I do believe in  
updating your Tech if you're using it to make 
a living because it's one of those things where  
money out will equal more money in I spend so much 
of my work day on this desk on my laptop and the  
majority 30 of my income streams rely on my laptop 
so it only makes sense for this to be operating in  
the most efficient way possible so I feel that 
investing in good Tech or good anything that  
you need to get the job done faster or to improve 
the efficiencies of your money making stream then  
it's a no-brainer seventh is learning this for me 
came after school at school I was more focused on  
just getting good grades than actually learning 
and understanding the subject and I guess part  
of this comes down to the pressures of society 
that we need to excel we need to get really good  
grades we need to get into a good University we 
need to get a good job and that whole timeline  
rather than the focus on learning and developing 
as a person and becoming financially lecturer and  
I know the word courses are quite frowned upon but 
I've paid for so many and I feel like there is a  
lot of and a lot of scans out there and that's 
why people kind of roll their eyes when they  
hear the word course but investing in the right 
course can seriously fast track your learning a  
lot of us are in friend groups or surrounded by 
people that are in very similar positions to us  
they're very similar to us and I feel like this 
makes it that much harder to get that breakthrough  
if that's what you want because it makes it more 
difficult to learn and pick up things than if you  
are already in that group of circle to start off 
with you can just learn a lot just by matter of  
Osmosis in this day and age the information Gap is 
closing thanks to the internet and possibilities  
and the opportunities are available for more 
and more people to take up regardless of their  
background you can learn what's taken someone 
else years and years to learn in a day or in a  
week and I think it's amazing and it really should 
be utilized ninth on my list is my whiteboard that  
I have up over there I have my overarching goal 
across the top and then all my actions of the  
week that will get me closer to there if you 
watch my video on how I set my goals for this  
year link up here if you haven't already but I 
mentioned in that video how I use a whiteboard  
to track what I think is the most important part 
of your goal setting process and that is your lead  
measures these are the actionable things that you 
are doing every single day forget the goal just  
focus on the lead measures so this whiteboard is 
updated every Sunday night for the week ahead if  
there's one way to stay accountable is by having 
your tasks shoved in your face the entire day I've  
made so many of my friends buy one it's honestly 
a game changer ninth on this list is something I  
want to add because I feel like I did a lot of it 
in my early 20s but haven't done so much recently  
and that is spending money on experiences and new 
activities whether it's taking your weekend out in  
the countryside to trying out a new activity for 
the first time I would always value spending money  
towards creating a memory over a tangible item 
that can be replaced and I really want to make  
sure that we don't get so caught up in trying to 
make a living that we forget to live so I guess  
I'm adding this to this list to make myself 
more accountable and just like how I spent  
my early 20s making the best memories with the 
people closest to me I want to make sure I do  
the same thing going into my 30s so those are some 
of my favorite purchases that I've had the biggest  
impact in my life I love to know what is your 
single best purchase that has made the biggest  
impact to your life thank you so much for watching 
and I hope to see you in one of my next videos"
hrmkylMitsk,"taxes are going to be one of the largest expenses 
of your life and whilst you have to pay it there  
are many ways in which you can reduce your 
tax bill legally so in this video I'm going  
to uncover what they are and how you can keep more 
of what you make this video is a highly requested  
one I asked you in one of my recent videos if you 
want to see this video on text that I had planned  
out and out of the 1000 plus comments 95 of you 
were all for it as a disclaimer I am a qualified  
accountant but I am not a financial advisor I'm 
just educating you on the possibilities of what  
can broadly be done wherever you live but with 
this information you need to find out what is  
relevant for your own country and seek Financial 
advice in the country that you're in right if that  
introduction didn't give you enough time to click 
off then you're here to stay so let's get into it  
I'm going to be bold and assume you have zero 
knowledge about taxes and so I'm going to cover  
the basics the misconceptions and then build it 
out from there I've got everything time stamped in  
the description below so you can click to whatever 
part that interests you the most and they'll also  
be follow-up videos to this as well as we get 
more and more into the details let's start with  
How is income tax calculated there is a common 
misconception that the more money you make the  
higher the tax rate you'll pay on your full salary 
and so I was speaking with someone last week and  
he was saying how he doesn't want a pay rise 
because he's currently at the 20 tax bracket and  
if he gets a pay rise it will move him into the 
40 tax bracket so he will end up making less money  
but this isn't exactly correct most countries have 
tax brackets and these tax brackets are different  
depending on what part of the world you're in but 
they apply in a similar way using a progressive  
tax system so what that means is you get taxed on 
the next pound or dollar of income depending on  
what bracket that next pound or dollar falls into 
so say you had the following tax brackets in the  
country that you live in if you're an employee 
earning 60 000 that means you fall into the 40  
bracket but it doesn't mean you're paying 40 of 
that full 60 000 in taxes what it actually means  
is that for the first 10 000 you're not paying 
anything in taxes once you max out that bracket  
you move into the next bracket so you're paying 
20 rate for the next Forty thousand until you Max  
that out and then you move it to the next bracket 
which is forty percent until you Max that out but  
in this case it's just the remaining ten thousand 
so if you're making sixty thousand according to  
these numbers you're paying twelve thousand 
in taxes this is broadly how it works there  
are some nuances and you want to check for your 
country what those nuances are for example with  
the UK once you hit six figures as an employee 
then you start losing that tax free allowance so  
effectively paying even more away in tax now we've 
covered that let's move on to how you can reduce  
through pension contribution pension contribution 
is called different things depending on where you  
are it's the 401K if you're in the US so you need 
to check what it's referred to in your respective  
country what's the idea behind this if you're 
an employee working for a corporation you are  
getting taxed straight away as soon as that money 
comes through the door it is getting taxed before  
you even see it but with a pension contribution 
you're able to put a portion of your paycheck  
away into your pension port and then you'll get 
taxed on whatever is left so the end result will  
be you pay income tax on a smaller amount and 
whatever money that is in your pension Port will  
be invested with tax-free earnings so say your 
salary is sixty thousand if you weren't putting  
away anything into your pension and assuming no 
other deductions you'd be paying 12 000 in taxes  
as we spoke about earlier now say you decide to 
instead put 500 a month of that into your pension  
or into your 401k every month so that's 6 000 in 
the year that goes straight into your pension Port  
without getting taxed and so your taxable income 
instead of it now being sixty thousand it's fifty  
four thousand so instead of paying 12 000 in taxes 
you're only paying nine thousand six hundred this  
is even better if you have an employer that has a 
match contribution system and so for every pound  
or dollar that you put in they do the same this 
is free money that's also tax free on the flip  
side on the downside however that this money is 
locked away and you can't access it until you  
retire although there are things you can do like 
borrowing from it to buy property for example but  
generally speaking this is you saving away until 
you retire if you are in a position to contribute  
to your pension and you don't necessarily need 
that money at the moment this is a really good way  
to reduce your taxable income and therefore reduce 
the tax that you pay the next way to produce a tax  
bill and this is one that I briefly touched 
upon in my bad money Habits video is to make  
sure you're earning through the right structure 
suitable for your position and in this case  
we're talking about as a company rather than as an 
individual and this really applies when you have a  
side hustle or a business so for example I'm here 
speaking to you as an individual but I'm operating  
as a business so the way I'm getting paid from 
sponsors from Affiliates from YouTube is through  
a company that I've set up and all I needed to do 
was firstly set up a company online and secondly  
set up a company bank account so all my invoices 
have my company Bank name on it so as an employee  
working for a corporation you earn you pay taxes 
and then you spend whatever's left so if I'm  
earning 60k I pay 12K in taxes and then I have 48 
000 left to spend now say I earn the same amount  
through YouTube as a side hustle I earn 60 000 
I'll then deduct my expenses so that can include a  
wide variety of things that can include my camera 
my mic my laptop that I used to edit a portion of  
my electricity bills for this room as it's my work 
from home YouTube or Studio courses meets there  
are a lot of things that you can expense which 
you want to speak to your advisor about and then  
you pay tax on the remaining amount and on top 
of that the company or the corporation tax rate  
isn't the same as the income tax brackets we saw 
earlier and in most Western countries it's a lower  
rate and in the UK at the moment it's currently 
19 so as long as I keep this money in the company  
I won't be paying any income tax on it I can keep 
spending on business stuff and investing through  
my company and deducting it as an expense what I 
can also do if I wanted to is draw myself a salary  
but the moment you draw money out of this company 
is subject to those income tax brackets we spoke  
about earlier so you you want to structure this 
in a way where you stay in the lower threshold  
and reduces the overall tax that you're paying the 
next way to pay less tax relative to the amount  
you make is by earning money through streams 
that the government views as non-taxable one of  
the most simple but effective ways to do that is 
through investing via a stocks and shares Isa this  
is called different things in different countries 
in the US it's a Roth IRA and this is essentially  
an investment account that Shields your profits 
and gains from the tax man and I'll show you how  
this doesn't reduce your taxable income this year 
but you get the tax benefits on the back end when  
you pull it out at least this is the way it is 
right now if you're in the UK you may have seen  
the recent headlines that Jeremy Hunt is looking 
to introduce some new rules around this tax free  
saving we'll wait to see how that pans out but in 
the meantime I'm currently maximizing out my ISO  
allowance as much as possible in the meantime 
but there are a number of investment platforms  
you can use one of them being trading 212 which 
is an investment platform that I've used for the  
last four years and they're also sponsoring this 
video this app has the typical things I look for  
and that's firstly that's regulated in this case 
it's FCA regulated it has an automatic investment  
feature which makes me a lot more disciplined 
with my resting and thirdly I can buy fractional  
shares with xero commission if you're new to 
investing then I have an ultimate beginner guide  
to investing and I'll link that here for you but 
what I like about this Investment app as well is  
that it has a practice mode and a real money 
mode which means you can start investing and  
practicing to invest with fake money with pretend 
money that reflects the current markets and then  
once you're ready you can move into the real mode 
trading 212 are giving anyone who signs up using  
the coupon code Nisha n-i-s-c-h-a a free share 
worth up to 100 pounds what you do with your few  
shares is none of my business you can invite 
another friend you can get more free shares  
you can sell and cash out if you want to but a 
better option in my opinion would be to use this  
to start your investment journey in a way where 
any gains are tax-free I've started this tax video  
series with three of the most applicable ways to 
reduce your tax bill but honestly this is me just  
scratching the surface in future videos I can go 
over how to set up offshore accounts which again  
is available to Everyday citizens like you and I 
not just the Facebook and linkedins of the world  
I can go over property tax stamp Duty how to get 
energy efficient cars for nearly half the price  
for the tax savings or if you have something 
else you've heard and want me to make a video  
about then let me know in the comments below and 
I'll make that for you this is just guidance but  
I promise you spending a few hundred here or 
there for a professional advisor is well worth  
it it will save you thousands in the long run if 
you found this video helpful please share it it  
helps spread the message of financial education 
to more people I've also got another video here  
on Investing For Beginners and I'll leave it 
here for you thank you so much for watching  
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already 
and I hope to see you in one of my next videos"
h3pB2sBTRJk,"as much as we like to think that we are rational 
and logical human beings the reality is that the  
way we think about money is driven by subconscious 
programming from When We Were Young and these  
things have a bigger impact on our finances than 
we like to think as someone who has been in some  
form of Finance related environment for over 10 
years I have seen firsthand that we don't need  
to accept the beliefs around money that we have 
been conditioned with so let's get into what they  
are and how we can break them the first belief is 
that working more hours equals more money when I  
really understood this I completely changed up the 
way I did things and the different ways in which  
I now make money there is a common misbelief 
that the more hours you put into something the  
greater the output and the more money you'll make 
from it if I put in 10 hours of work I'm going to  
get out 10 hours of output but it doesn't always 
work that way if you've seen my other videos you  
know that I've made money through many different 
income streams and the amount of money I make from  
each of these definitely doesn't equate to the 
hours of work I put in for them let's look at a  
95 corporate job you start making money from day 
one straight away as soon as you start working  
you get a paycheck month on month and the moment 
you stop working or the moment you stop picking  
your time that paycheck stops coming through 
so in this case the hours you put in reflects  
the output and the money you make from it but 
there are also other streams of income where  
your output isn't reflective of your input and it 
doesn't rely on you trading your time so looking  
at the Creator economy and more specifically one 
that I am familiar with now which is YouTube this  
is one that initially I was putting in hours and 
hours of work for every evening and every weekend  
and I didn't see any output in return I didn't 
make a single penny from it however fast forward  
a year and even though I'm putting in less hours 
than I would have in a corporate job I made more  
in the last four weeks than I have in four months 
working for an organization so there are different  
ways you can make money outside of a nine-to-five 
corporate job where it doesn't rely on you trading  
your time to make money and I do want to be really 
cute hair I know there's a common message about  
quitting your job and following your why but I 
don't think we should discredit the fact that  
working a 95 or an eight to a or a 10 to 10 or 
whatever it is it's a solid foundation and for  
the majority of us it is a must to keep the cash 
coming in but I don't believe in just stopping  
there and to truly build wealth in a way that 
gives you freedom and Independence it's important  
to also find ways to make money where your output 
is not so heavily linked to your input and as  
Nevada ravacan puts it to earn money with your 
mind and not with your time the second belief to  
drop is the victim mentality this is one that I've 
had to work on but the more I'm applying this the  
more I'm feeling myself grow and move forward how 
often have you said I can't do this I can't start  
that business I can't start with that podcast I 
can't do that thing these thoughts whatever it is  
is immediately taking you out of the game because 
you can't prove a negative you can only say that  
you have not achieved it yet once upon a time it 
was considered impossible for any human being to  
run a mile in less than four minutes until Roger 
Bannister did it in Oxford in the 1950s and then  
when that strange thing happened more and more 
athletes started running a mile in under four  
minutes and now his impossible achievement is 
a common place there are so many times in a day  
that I have a limiting belief that crosses my mind 
I'm not good at storytelling I don't have enough  
knowledge I'm not skilled enough but every time 
now that I say something like this I consciously  
add the word yet to the end I don't have enough 
knowledge yet I'm not skilled enough yet and then  
that yet is just an indicator to me that either 
I need to go over it and just wing it or I need  
to do some more work and upskill myself so that 
I am ready there are genuine victim limitations  
I don't doubt that but even then there have been 
so many anomalies that have proved against the  
norm and I do believe a better thought process 
before any negative belief comes through is to  
reinterpret it and not let that belief box 
you into a life of mediocrity third belief  
is the competition trap it's easy to follow the 
crowd and do the same thing as everyone else is  
doing in life because it's comfortable and because 
it's safe but this becomes problematic when you're  
trying to have an advantage and there is a saying 
that your goal isn't to beat the competition it's  
to escape the competition altogether Peter Theo 
here is the co-founder of PayPal and he speaks  
about this a lot he himself was trapped competing 
with his peers to climb the corporate ranks in one  
of the top law firms as this is what Society had 
indicated was the right thing to do and eventually  
he got to a point where he took a step back and 
questioned why he was even competing on this  
thing and whether it really was what he wanted 
when he did that he realized that this type of  
conventional competition was trapping him down 
a path that he didn't even want to go down and  
eventually he reassessed his Direction and pivoted 
to establish one of the largest companies in the  
world competition can be in the form of applying 
for a specific job because everyone else says it  
can be through going for a promotion because 
everyone else says it could mean making money  
through a specific side hustle because that's what 
everyone else is it's easy to follow the crowd and  
get swept up with where the competition is and 
when you compete very intensively you can also be  
good at the thing that your computer on but you 
need to ask yourself enough critical questions  
along the way and ask yourself is this even me and 
I know the importance of this because I've been  
there and you can lose yourself if you go too far 
down this path because we may find that actually  
copying people around us and their desires 
and what Society is telling us is the right  
path might actually just be swaying us off the 
track that we should be on and I truly believe to  
escape competition is to be authentic to yourself 
understand what your core skills and strengths are  
what you stand for and then build and Market 
something that's just an extension of who you  
are then no one can compete with you you've just 
invented a whole new game the fourth self-limiting  
money belief is thinking that money is evil in 
the book master the game by Tony Robbins Robin  
writes that having limiting beliefs around money 
and emotions towards money can prevent you from  
making it and these limiting beliefs operate in 
your subconscious mind and you probably don't  
even realize it but they have an impact on your 
behavior in terms of money these limiting beliefs  
can be things like oh rich people are greedy or 
anyone who makes a lot of money is dishonest or  
you can't be spiritual if you're making money 
that's another common one now there is such  
thing as unethical wealth creation and there is 
such thing as economic Injustice and there is  
such thing as read I don't doubt that however 
that doesn't mean that everybody who is making  
money is doing it from a place where there are no 
good intentions and I fully believe if you judge  
someone else for anything great that they have in 
their life you will block that thing from entering  
into your own life sometimes we look at people who 
have money and we make assumptions that to get to  
where they have they've lied they've backstabbed 
they've cheated someone and it hasn't been done in  
a healthy way but if you have a judgment of people 
just because they created wealth you're putting  
out the message that you just think is evil and 
so if that's the case how and why will you attract  
more of it so instead of looking at other people 
who have money with jealousy and anger rather take  
it as an Avenue for inspiration that if they could 
do it maybe I can do it too and maybe I can't take  
the exact path and do it in the same way that 
they've done it but I can use that inspiration  
to create my own path the fifth money trapped is 
using the words I can't afford it growing up my  
siblings and I weren't allowed to use the phrase 
I can't afford it in my family household and it's  
only now years later where I've actually read 
about phrases like this and the psychological  
benefits behind it if we wanted something and 
we actually thought that it was worth the value  
or exchange of money we had to pay we were told 
to replace I can't afford it with how am I going  
to afford it telling yourself that you can't 
that money is too scarce or that the game is  
rigged only causes you to feel disempowered 
and to become complacent about your finances  
instead of thinking about ways to structure it 
and make more mindset is so important and it  
actually just takes a matter of understanding and 
examining these thoughts and then reprogramming  
your mind for Success so these are some beliefs 
that I am dropping ASAP to build wealth in a way  
that gives me Freedom if you like this video you 
may also enjoy another one that I have made on

uf_wimk2keU,"I have received a lot of questions recently 
about how I Grew From 1 000 subscribers to  
100 000 subscribers in under 90 days so in this 
video I'm sharing with you 10 things that I did  
and things that I didn't do to grow on YouTube 
here we go number one the mere exposure effect  
I know you've heard of the importance of being 
consistent time and time again but I'll be lying  
to you if I didn't include this as one of the 
most important factors that contributed to the  
growth of this channel but many people seem 
to just stop here insanity is doing the same  
thing over and over again and expecting different 
results first thing is being consistent and it  
was during me posting twice a week for almost 
three months straight that's where my channel  
saw its biggest growth but it wasn't just being 
consistent churning videos week in and week out  
isn't going to get you anywhere if you aren't 
improving as you're going every now and then  
take a step back and reassess the direction of 
your channel reassess the quality reassess the  
content and whether you need to continue plugging 
away if that's the direction you want to go in or  
whether you should pivot if you want to have a 
look at how I started just look at my very first  
video on this channel it's super embarrassing 
but I've left it on my Channel with its original  
thumbnail because I don't want people to come 
onto my channel and create a fake perception  
that I've just common to YouTube and I had it 
all figured out I like everyone else started  
from somewhere and I still have a very long way 
to go so don't be disheartened if your quality  
isn't Mr B standards right from the get-go next 
up we have lean into who you are in a world where  
everyone is trying to be like someone else who is 
doing well on YouTube lean into yourself you want  
to figure out the value you can bring to other 
people what value you can provide to their lives  
from that you have the perfect foundation and a 
lot of the value comes through bringing your full  
self through when I first started out on YouTube I 
had no intention to talk about self-development or  
business and it was purely meant to be focused 
at property investing UK property investing it  
was only a couple of months ago where I brought 
in the other side of me onto the channel what I  
do for a living my failures my Highs are my lows 
and that's where I saw things pick up there are  
a lot of books and a lot of textbooks that can 
teach the same thing so differentiate Yourself  
by infusing your personality and your perspective 
on things next we have provide valuable content  
people don't want you to waste their time and so 
don't wait for a 10 minute video don't wait till  
the seventh minute before you provide valuable 
content you want your videos to be providing  
the best value throughout that whole video for 
me that's what I've always tried to do I spent  
hours researching filming and consolidating hours 
of reading and Research into the shortest video  
possible one of the ways to understand if you 
are providing valuable information is by asking  
yourself will I sit and watch this video and if 
the answer is no then reassess ask yourself how  
can I make this more interesting or more engaging 
next we have get the audio right so this is where  
I screwed up a bit and if you go through some 
of the comments in my older videos you will see  
the frustration from some of the viewers regarding 
the sound quality what I've learned is that people  
don't mind a not so great video quality and they 
can sit through that but people do want a good  
audio quality so if you want to spend some money 
wisely spend it on upgrading your audio first  
it's a mistake I learned the hard way get to know 
your audience and your community if you have 100  
followers and you don't talk to them you don't 
message them you don't read the comments you'll  
never know what people are looking for and what 
they are appreciating the replies on my comments  
are from me there's no one else there's no not a 
team member replying to the comments I'm reading  
every single comment and this is really important 
part of knowing your audience and understanding  
topics that they're looking for I'm not saying 
you need to agree and change everything in your  
video so that it makes everyone happy you'll never 
be able to make everyone happy but sometimes they  
will tell you something that you can't necessarily 
see for yourself and if you're a very small  
Channel and you've just started and you're not 
getting comments or feedback then ask your closest  
friends and family for feedback and then decide 
what you want to take on board find something you  
care about the internet can be a very distracting 
thing and you might see a lot of shiny light shiny  
objects and decide you want to create content here 
and here and you want to go on the trendy page and  
this video will make you go viral and grow really 
quickly but this isn't the right approach because  
it always comes back to what you stand for and 
what your audience needs from you that will  
provide value for them a lot of people seem to be 
going into specific niches on YouTube because it  
pays but if it's not something you truly enjoy 
and have a passion about and understand then a  
people will see right through it and your energy 
will come through and B you're going to give  
up before you even reap the rewards and see the 
results it took me almost a year to get monetized  
from YouTube and you can see how much I made in my 
first month in monetization through another video  
which I'll link up here but my point is that if 
you don't enjoy something then you're not going to  
try and overcome the challenges and obstacles that 
will come at you because it is a long game so you  
need to get past that initial hurdle next talking 
about thumbnails your thumbnails represent your  
brand and you want them to speak for your brand at 
first glance you'll see all my recent videos they  
have a very similar format similar font similar 
color scheme and so that whenever I release the  
video people can automatically recognize that 
it's one of my videos and it creates a sense of  
familiarity also on this point when it comes to 
titles you want them to be catchy but you don't  
want it to be clickbait if it's clickbait people 
are going to click off pretty quickly and it's not  
going to be seen by a wide group of people don't 
chase the money once an audience loses trust in  
you it'll be super hard to regain that trust again 
and there have been the rise and fall of countless  
countless YouTubers for this reason as an example 
I've turned down thousands and thousands worth of  
sponsorships because I didn't believe in the 
companies I either don't use it or the company  
doesn't align with the messaging I'm trying to 
bring to my audience so if you chase the money  
I truly believe you YouTube stent will be very 
short-lived people will be able to see through  
that the incentives can be high so your ethics 
will be tested but you really want to be picky  
with who you want to bring onto your channel 
and showcase and Market to your audience next  
up we have backup what you're saying I think it is 
incredibly important to back up what you're saying  
and let your audience know why you are saying 
that is it from experience is it from other  
people doing it have you tried it it all ties 
into credibility and I speak on my skillshare  
class about how you could show credibility even 
more but if someone tries to challenge something  
you said if you know you've done the research you 
have the facts and figures to back up what you're  
saying and you have experience to prove why you've 
said that thing then it'll be a lot easier to deal  
even internally with any comments or any nasty 
comments I have people disagreeing with me in  
my comments and actually I really enjoy seeing 
their perspective but equally I don't feel the  
need to debate because I know I've done my work 
and I know why I'm saying why I have whatever  
content or whatever information you're putting 
out make sure it's coming from from a place of  
understanding and credibility finally stop caring 
and start you're going to find enough excuses not  
to do that thing when it comes to starting 
a YouTube channel the number one reason why  
people don't do it is because they're scared of 
what other people will think if you think about  
it the goal of starting a channel is that you want 
to impact as many people as possible and you want  
as many people as possible to see your videos so 
don't worry about the few hundred people that you  
know in real life starting as hard I was petrified 
when I first did it and to this day every time a  
video goes out my heart still sinks a little 
bit but think about the opportunity cost of not  
starting say you start a channel you work at it 
very hard for a year and you don't see returns and  
you don't see results and you find that YouTube 
isn't for you that's fine you would have learned  
a lot and you would have picked up so many skills 
along the way but if you don't start you will  
always regret that one time or what if I tried and 
what if I started that YouTube channel the pain  
of constantly reliving the what if outweighs the 
immediate pain of when you upload your first video  
and what few people you know say about it so just 
go for it I remember this time last year I was on  
the other side watching other content creators say 
if I can do it then you can do it as well and that  
gave me the courage I needed to get started and 
inspired and feel like this is possible I can do  
this and I hope that from this video I can pass 
it on to people watching my video as well I think  
it's super important to be transparent about this 
openly talk about the highs the lows the failures  
the successes because being open about that 
doesn't take anything away from me so I hope  
you enjoyed this video if you want to know more 
about monetization and how it works on YouTube  
then I also have a specific video on that and 
I'll link that here for you thank you for watching  
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already 
and I hope to see you in one of my next videos"
Q0uXGQu55GM,"I have spent the last decade of my life immersing 
myself in the field of finance and money through a  
degree in finance a qualification in accounting 
and then a career in Investment Banking and one  
of the most life-changing skills I have learned 
through it all is how to handle my own finances  
recognize my bad money habits and break free from 
them so in this video I'm going to share with you  
nine of the most common bad money habits that 
hold people back and tips on how to break out  
of them number one paying yourself last I first 
heard of this in the book Rich Dad Poor Dad by  
Robert Kiyosaki and it's one of the blueprints in 
achieving Financial Freedom Robert explains that  
the way people pay their bills can be broken down 
into two types the first way is the Poor People's  
habit and that is through paying yourself last 
so as soon as your paycheck comes in you then  
pay your rent your phone bill your subscriptions 
you find your social plans and then you'll save  
whatever's left over if there is even any money 
left to save the second method he talks about is  
the rich people's habit and they do the complete 
opposite they pay themselves first and that is  
what you want to do take 10 minimum and put that 
into your savings account the minute you get paid  
treat it like paying a bill this is so important 
and by doing this you're guaranteeing that that  
buying their things before you pay yourself the 
second bad money habit is getting comfortable  
with bad debt it seems that debt these days is 
actually the norm people are using debt to by  
the smallest of things to buy presents to buy 
clothes I have a straight wall that is unless  
I can afford to pay for that thing outright and 
cash I shouldn't be buying it with any form of  
debt remember credit card companies want you to 
be bad with your finances because that's how they  
make money from this the average credit card 
interest rate is 22 which cancels all kind of  
benefits and rewards these credit card companies 
are providing if you're not able to pay them off  
number one which is about paying yourself first 
and essentially it's saving enough so that you  
this six months of buffer it's through that paying 
yourself first start putting that 10 away and once  
you have your stockpile then you can start using 
the additional money you save to building into  
your investment fund and looking at Investments 
number four is not knowing your income or expenses  
properly until you know what your starting point 
is how do you know where you want to be there's  
something called lifestyle inflation and that is 
your spending will rise as your income Rises the  
more money you make the more you spend and it's 
a cycle make more money buy a bigger house buy a  
financially they know their assets they know their 
liabilities they have a clear goal on where they  
want to go financially and all this all the steps 
they need to take to get there are more likely to  
get a lot of money and build wealth compared 
to people who just fantasize about money but  
have no idea how to go about it how they plan to 
acquire it or how to manage it just being mindful  
of their stuff and seeing those numbers in black 
and white will trigger you into action fifth bad  
money habit is having expensive Hobbies a lot of 
people like to shop and I guess yeah part of this  
if you want to improve your financial position you 
can firstly save more of your existing income or  
you can make more money and create more income 
streams and the ideal combination is a mixture  
of both you can't build wealth if you're making 
more money and spending all but you also can't if  
you're just focusing on the saving side because 
there is a cap to how much you can save using  
those cashback sites will only get you so far so 
to truly build wealth you have to think of both  
sides of the equation both how you will save a 
larger percentage of your income but also how  
you will make more money saving moneyside has a 
cap the making money side does not it's infinite  
there is unlimited potential upside whether it's 
investing in the stock market asking for a pay  
rise starting a side hustle you want to break the 
bad money habit of thinking about saving money  
is going to massively increase your wealth number 
seven paying too much in taxes taxes are going to  
be the single biggest expense in your life whilst 
everyone has to pay tax a lot of people just  
wealthy they have knowledge of illegal corporate 
structures that come with tax advantages they hire  
tax advisors that help them minimize their tax 
bills so if you want to get one step ahead one of  
the best ways to increase your wealth is through 
understanding tax rules in a way that's stack up  
in your favor for example investing through 
an Isa or a Roth IRA which is an investment  
account that shelters your dividend and profit 
from taxes or operating under a business instead  
if you are someone who disagrees with this and 
prefers to pay more taxes regardless of whether  
or not you can reduce it legally then it doesn't 
hurt to understand the tax rules and reduce that  
tax bill so that you can instead use the money 
to give back to things that directly align with  
your values instead of letting someone else decide 
where that money should be going if you want me to  
make a video on tax I was planning to I already 
have a summary on what I want to include but I  
have been a bit skeptical about whether to release 
this it's a topic that can go either way so let  
me know in the comments below if you want to see 
that number eight waiting too long to invest when  
you start having savings you have that stockpile 
that buffer that we spoke about then you want to  
start looking at investing that money so that 
your money starts working for you and you want  
to diversify those Investments so you can weather 
different situations operations that come around  
in life but you want to avoid leaving that money 
in a bank account because inflation is a thing  
and it means that you're essentially losing money 
every year so I have a mixture of safe Investments  
of riskier Investments that I'm willing to lose 
as well start looking at different investment  
strategies once you've saved up enough don't leave 
any additional money more than you need to in a  
bank account I have another video and what you 
can be doing with your money in times like the  
current recession and I'll link that here for you 
as well there's always going to be reasons why  
you can't invest because you don't have time you 
don't have enough money you don't know where to  
start but the longer you put off investing the 
harder you will have to work to get that same

7GYPZc4nsOk,"there is a strong correlation between goal 
setting and success and that's because the  
idea of setting goals is linked with higher 
motivation self-confidence and autonomy  
according to a 2015 study on the psychology of 
goal setting over the past couple of weeks I  
have read up on research papers on literature 
and studies around the concept of goal setting  
and how best to apply it and so in this video I 
thought it'd be interesting to share with you my  
vision my roadmap on getting to my vision and 
the three-step formula that I'll be using to  
set my goals and give them the best possible 
chance of success let's get into it before I  
even think about setting my goals the very first 
thing I do is craft out my vision for the future  
what do I want my life to look like in five 
years or in 10 years time this can change it  
isn't set in stone but by spending some time 
to really think about what you want it makes  
you understand what you're working towards 
and why and a really good way to think about  
what your vision is and I heard this on a podcast 
recently is to ask yourself if I Was 80 years old  
telling people about the best parts 
of my life what would I want to say  
doing this step and being super clear about your 
vision is so important because if you don't know  
what you really want you'll be swept away with 
someone else's Vision there are so many people  
selling courses and products on what's worked for 
them and their Vision but that doesn't necessarily  
mean it will work for you so you want to take some 
time and figure out what you ultimately want and  
then hone in on that so for me my vision involves 
having time and location Freedom so being able  
to work from anywhere I want to whenever I want 
to whilst also providing some sort of value and  
impact to others that's my vision and then I need 
to think about a roadmap which is essentially my  
strategy and how I plan to get to my vision so do 
I focus on saving up a lot so I could eventually  
quit and do some charity work abroad or do I 
focus more on making more money and building up  
my passive income streams online whilst providing 
value at the same time so it's about knowing what  
your strategy should be and how you plan to get to 
your vision once you've done that the next layer  
is actually setting the goals to get you there 
and for this I'm using a three-step formula the  
first step in that formula is knowing how many 
goals to set and how to set them it's undeniable  
that we all have other commitments going on all 
of us we just need to recognize that there are  
different things that will come up in different 
ways demanding more or less time from us in some  
way whether it's your day job whether it's the 
kids there's always something so whatever it is  
research shows that the maximum number of goals 
you should set for yourself in any year is three  
and then you should focus all of your energy on 
those this was really hard for me I had made a  
whole list of goals so I got that down to just 
three and I put the rest at the back of my book  
that I could always refer to but I had my key 
three ones once you've chosen your top three you  
want to break them down with a time frame and into 
quantifiable measures so say one of your goals is  
to save and invest more and you want to save 12 
Grand this year finger in the air saying you want  
to save 12 Grand in the year isn't really going 
to kick you into action straight away so what you  
want to do instead is break that down what this 
means is instead of saying you want to save 12  
Grand this year say instead that maybe you want 
to save 3 000 in the next three months and then  
another three okay and then another three grand 
in the three months after and so on so on you  
could always change your goal depending on how you 
performed the three months before but by giving  
yourself a three months time frame that now gives 
you a sense of urgency and a need to act today and  
in the book The 12-week Year the authors suggest 
that if you give yourself any longer than three  
months and you lose focus and any shorter then 
your goals aren't big enough the authors also  
say that you want these goals to be ambitious 
and risky and you want to pick something that  
has a chance to fail even if you do everything 
in your power to achieve it because if you have  
a goal that you're guaranteed to accomplish you'll 
lose motivation then we move on to part two once  
you've set your key goals in a measurable way the 
second step is to focus on lead measures this is  
a key key part in the formula and Amy cardi who 
is a a Harvard psychologist states that this is  
the place where most people go wrong the biggest 
mistake with goal setting is that they only focus  
on the outcome and not the process and James Clear 
who is the author of atomic habits explains this  
really well he says say you're playing a sport in 
every sport the goal is to have the best score on  
the scoreboard at the end of the game but it'll 
be ridiculous to spend the whole game looking at  
the scoreboard because it won't help you in any 
way so instead if you ignore the score and focus  
on better playing on better strategy on better 
process then the score takes care of itself and  
if you take this and apply it to your goals what 
you're essentially doing is setting lead measures  
that you can influence more effectively than just 
focusing on the goal itself so for example if you  
want to save up a certain amount of money and all 
you're doing is continuously checking your bank  
account then you're not magically going to get any 
closer to hitting your goals so what you really  
want to do is focus on the lead measures and the 
efforts that you need to put in to move that goal  
so your lead measures for saving more can be 
for a given week call up to utility providers  
and negotiate your bill down or work X more hours 
or spend why this week and by doing this the goal  
will naturally take care of itself this is 
way more effective than just checking your  
bank balance and hoping that is bigger than before 
another thing that I like to do is write my goals  
and my lead measures for the week down and studies 
show that you are 33 more likely to achieve your  
goal if you write it down I have a whiteboard in 
my room it's over there and I have my targets for  
the month and then the top three things I need to 
do each week and I make sure it's visible at all  
times and I physically take it off as I go through 
it looking at mine and I haven't done most of the  
important things that I need to do this week 
but without that visible check especially if  
you're in business or if you're doing something 
for yourself it's easy to make up an excuse and  
just say no because you don't have anyone checking 
up on you so that motivation needs to come through  
from somewhere else which leads me to part 
number three which is pretty straightforward  
but it's arguably the make or break in this 
whole goal setting formula that is to have an  
accountability partner there was a study conducted 
in 2015 by Dr Matthews and he gained evidence for  
claims that were coming from Harvard Business 
School around goals and their performance and  
he did a study where participants were recruited 
from different businesses and they were divided  
into different groups the first group they had 
no goals and no plan the second group they had  
written goals but no plan to get there the third 
group they had written goals and also a well  
executed plan and the final group they had written 
goals a well-executed plan and an accountability  
partner to check their weekly progress and results 
revealed that the final group who had the support  
of someone to hold them accountable accomplished 
significantly more than all of the other groups  
so how can you bring this into your goal setting 
process what this essentially means is sitting  
down with someone someone close to you it can 
be your close friend it can be your relationship  
partner it could be your business partner and 
go through every week for 20 minutes or you said  
you were going to do that week and whether or 
not you actually did the thing make this really  
short Maybe make this really Punchy it's not 
something that you want to dread through doing  
this you're making a commitment to your partner 
that these are the things I said I was going to  
do and I've either done them or I haven't here 
my partner we do this on Friday so if I haven't  
done something towards the end of the week then 
by Thursday my productivity massively wraps up  
I know some other people who also put money on 
the line and they say okay if I don't get this  
done by next week then that money on the line is 
yours to keep now if your goal is to save more  
money then that throws a massive spanner in the 
works so the accountability partner really works  
for me it gives me a push at the end of the week 
so I have the weekend to chill out a bit if your  
roadmap this year is to save more then I have a 
specific video for you and if your roadmap is to  
make more money then I also have a video for you 
so that's my three-step formula on setting goals  
in a way that gives me zero excuse or Reason to 
back out I approached my goals last year in a  
similar way but I'm incorporating more of these 
learnings into this year's goals and how I plan  
to execute them if you have any tips or tricks 
or things that worked for you let me know thank  
you so so much for watching as always and 
I hope to see you in one of my next videos"
1LnhXn3gL7k,"we're getting to that point in the year where 
everyone looks back and then everyone looks  
forward the dedicated Instagram post the New 
Year's resolutions the highlight reels and on  
today's video I am going to do just that what 
are the top five things this year has taught  
me and how can we make next year better than 
the last number one Parkinson's law in action  
one of the greatest lessons from this year and one 
of my objectives looking forward is to create a  
greater sense of urgency in life there's a common 
concept called Parkinson's law and it's that work  
expands to fill the time that we allocate to it so 
what this means is basically if I say I'm going to  
write an essay in two weeks or in two months or in 
two days very often the quality of the work isn't  
going to be too different in these three different 
scenarios and sometimes if you give yourself an  
outrageously tight timeline or an outrageously 
tight deadline you'll end up doing a lot more  
than you expected and you won't procrastinate 
whereas if you give yourself an unlimited amount  
of time you risk that thing taking forever so 
creating these false deadlines for me I feel is  
so important it's not about being tense or being 
stressed out or burning out it's more about being  
focused and demanding from yourself that your 
most important goals are your priority and so  
they are achieved as soon as possible by doing 
this you will eliminate all the distractions the  
excuses the fears you give yourself no choice 
but to find a way to get that thing done on the  
projects and the side hustles that I didn't create 
a sense of urgency I found that it dragged out for  
far longer than it should have and I wasted so 
much time and what I really should have done was  
just full Fast fail fast and fail forward now 
everything important that I want to do I will  
move fast no matter how ambitious it is I'll give 
myself a ridiculously short time frame a fraction  
of the time that I think it's possible to get that 
thing done and then create a sense of urgency this  
is the way to focus on what matters and declutter 
everything else number two compounding I've got  
three quotes on my phone background and if you 
if you follow me on Instagram you would have  
seen this on my story it's you're the youngest 
you'll ever be compound effects and what is yours  
will come to you and the compound effects that 
really applies to so many areas of your life  
when it comes to investing when it comes to making 
money when it comes to growing an online presence  
it really is about patience and time in the last 
couple of weeks this channel has grown more than I  
had ever expected and I do believe it's because 
I was so consistent and I went all in remember  
one morning the morning where I recorded six key 
habits that made me six figures I've recorded it  
after having three hours of sleep I was out the 
night before for my friend's birthday and then  
I had a wedding the next day and I was so close 
to just staying in bed and things saying I'm not  
going to do it today but I forced myself to get 
up and just get that thing done the same thing  
happened with today's video my plan was to switch 
off until the new year and I thought it's fine  
no one's going to notice no one's even going to 
care and then I got my phone out and I saw those  
words glaring back at me compound effects and 
so I pushed myself up and I said no to do one  
Roundup video and then you're done the power of 
consistency at these moments where you don't want  
to do it that'll make all the difference and it's 
these moments where most people just call it a day  
so this is where the discipline needs to show 
up because that's when it's the most valuable  
discipline doesn't matter on the days that are 
good you don't really need it but discipline is  
on the days that are bad that's the bit that most 
people don't overcome I also want to add something  
that I feel like most people forget at this point 
and it's that consistency alone isn't everything  
and it's not all that you need it's consistency 
combined with improvements that makes a difference  
there is something called the mere exposure 
effect it's basically that doing something  
so many times makes us believe that we've become 
good at something completely independent of our  
actual performance and we don't want to confuse 
consistency with Improvement we want to combine  
them both together the third thing I've learned 
this year is not to box myself in there is a  
direct correlation I feel between the amount of 
respect that you have for yourself and the amount  
of respect you get from other people there have 
been many many times where I've been in a room  
with people who are far more experienced than me 
and have many years ahead of me and there was a  
specific time where I was in a meeting and I 
expressed my thoughts and views on something  
that had contradicted what someone much older 
to me and much more experience to me had said  
but I backed it up with evidence and with facts 
and after that meeting we were walking out and  
he pulled me up on it and told me to stay My 
Own Lane and at that point I didn't stand up  
for myself I didn't protect my value and I didn't 
respect myself enough I didn't say no what I said  
was valid and these are the points that back it 
and then a few months later something similar  
happened it was a similar instance and I handed 
it completely differently at that point I fully  
protected my boundaries and I demanded fact did 
I feel comfortable doing that not at all it was  
very hard but it was after that moment and 
demanding my worth where I saw the attitude  
completely changed sometimes you've just got to 
shut off the detractors with your work because  
there are so many people that will support you 
but there's also going to be some people who try  
to box you in through telling you what you can 
and what you can't do through expressing their  
views on your abilities and it is hard to remove 
yourself from moments like this but standing up  
for yourself and back in your corner is only 
something you can do and I've come to realize  
that the amount of respect you have for yourself 
is typically not always but it is typically The  
Benchmark of how someone else will respect you 
number four the Manson and the 80 20 rule as I  
was writing my reflections of this year I really 
came to the realization that I haven't been able  
to explore everything that I've wanted to there 
are so many things that have made me feel like I  
haven't fully lived my life I have procrastinated 
I've undervalued things that actually matter I've  
engaged in conversations where I shouldn't have 
and so going into next year I'm aligning more of  
me into things that actually matter and I've 
made a list of non-negotiables for next year  
these aren't uh money related these aren't wealth 
related these aren't project related these aren't  
side hustles are related these are just things 
that I want to do so that I can't look back and  
say I never fully live my life in the book 
The subtle art the author Mason says that we  
go through life giving a too much he says that we 
need to choose constructive values and standards  
and use them to decide what things we care about 
and then reject the Wrath and for me that includes  
wasting time on things that I don't really enjoy 
and that don't align to my bigger goals because  
time is very real it's very fleeting and I'll be 
combining his view with the 80 20 rule which is  
that 80 of your results come from 20 of what you 
do and this can apply to so many different areas  
of life figure out what 20 of your actions 20 
of your values 20 of your thoughts produce 80  
of the outcomes in your life and then Focus your 
energy on those the fifth most important lesson  
this year has taught me is the concept of unique 
pairing most things in life have been done nothing  
is really that original anymore and so we don't 
really have to worry about having an original idea  
because we can still take ideas from original 
sources and make them our own so even if you  
read all the new self-development books when you 
get to a certain point you realize that the key  
messages keep tying into each other they were 
all discovered years and years ago but they're  
just conveyed in different ways and before I 
started this channel I thought it's kind of  
pointless there are a million and one personal 
finance channels why would anyone want to hear  
this stuff from me but people really resonate 
with the same message differently depending on  
who it comes from and the way it's represented so 
I've come to realize don't take yourself out just  
because you think a market is saturated find a 
way to do it by adding your own authenticity and  
unique pairing and unique twist to it because 
a lot of life is about what you're meant to do  
uniquely statistics are staggering there's eight 
billion people in the world but you'll never  
find two people that can perfectly substitute each 
other I think for everyone there is something that  
they can do that other people say it looks like 
so much work and it looks like it's so hard but  
actually it's effortless and it's playful there 
but everyone has something like that so this is my  
reflection publicly I wanted to also say thank 
you so so much for watching my videos and for  
following me on this journey this year it 
honestly means a ton to me there have been  
little moments specific comments specific 
messages specific moments I've bumped into  
a few of you on the train in London and the 
response it's just something that makes me  
keep going it's not easy to keep consistently 
posting every single week but what drives me  
to get going is your feedback so thank you so 
much don't forget to subscribe if you haven't  
already and enjoy the festive period And if you 
have some time to binge watch some more videos  
I love two of my favorite ones here one is the 
six key habits that made me six figures and the  
other one is my plan to become a millionaire 
by 32. hope you enjoy them see you next year"
5Q6-5eUo0t0,"I've always wanted to know how much
YouTubers actually make I've watched so
many videos but they were made by people
who have millions of subscribers and
were making millions a year from it so I
really didn't know what to expect when I
got started so in this video I thought
it'd be interesting to share with you
all of my stats all of my numbers on how
much I made in my first month of being
eligible to make money on YouTube and to
be honest I was pretty shocked not many
small YouTubers do this especially not
in the personal finance Niche but I've
said it from the start this channel is
all about money and transparency so here
we go I started my YouTube channel
exactly a year ago in December 2021 and
I didn't make a single penny from
YouTube until November 2022 so it took
me just under a year to get monetized
slash make money from YouTube that was
one year of making videos but not
getting anything in return because to be
able to make money from YouTube you need
to meet two requirements the first is
that you need 1 000 subscribers which
took me 10 months to achieve and the
second is that you need to have 4 000
hours of watch time on your long form of
videos which took me 11 months to
achieve I was posting periodically at
the start every now and then but it was
in the last four months that I changed
things up I took it seriously and I
committed to it and I posted
consistently I posted twice a week every
week for four months straight and it was
during this period where I really saw
the growth of my channel so once I was
eligible to make money how much did I
start making as you can see from this
chart my Revenue has been zero dollars
for a very very long time YouTube
definitely isn't a get rich quick scheme
and then on November the 15th of this
year things hit differently I hit the
criteria of 1 000 subscribers and 4 000
hours of watch time and on my first day
of being monetized I made 41 day two I
made 59 day three I made forty dollars
and that number kept going up and up and
up as more viewers were coming in
through my channel and clicking on my
videos and on December the 8th that was
my best day last month and I made 296
dollars in one day that is pretty good
an extra 200 196 dollars in one day and
as you can see that number has come down
a bit since then so since then it's been
floating around the 130 150 a day and it
really fluctuates depending on how many
views I get any single day and in total
for the month I made four thousand and
forty eight dollars YouTube pays in
dollars so the exchange rate does make a
difference to how much I make in Great
British pounds but that roughly
translates to 3 300 pounds but what's
really interesting is how that number is
broken down and what it's based on so my
highest paying video is this video where
I talk about how I'll become a
millionaire by 32 very ironic I know but
that video made me 838 dollars but
what's super interesting is this video
or my day in the life as a banker got
100 000 views in the last 28 days and
those of you made a total of 487 dollars
for me but this video where I talk about
the pros and cons of buying versus
renting that video got far fewer views
it got 67 000 views in the same period
but it made me more or less the same
amount so why did I get paid the same
despite one video attracting way more
views and clicks than another video and
the answer to that is that the number of
views isn't the only thing that it takes
how much money I make actually the
amount I get paid depends on firstly
what the age category of people watching
my video is secondly where the majority
of viewers are based geographically so
are they based in India Bangladesh
Pakistan and ledcs or the likes of UK US
Canada and the third thing that dictates
how much I get paid is what I am
speaking about in my video and the
personal finance Niche is one of the
highest paying niches so a large bulk of
the viewers for this video were within
the 18 to 24 age category mostly being
students who don't actually have much
money to spend and likewise the
geographical reach for this video was
mostly India those two things combined
meant the amount I make per 1000 views
is far lower than what I made in this
buy versus rent video where the viewer
base was predominantly UK and the US and
94 of my viewers were above the age of
24. so taking all of this into account
that's how I made the 4048 which isn't
bad at all fact that covers my total
living expenses and more for the month
so that isn't a bad place to be but was
that easy money or is that easy money no
not right now I've put hours and hours
of work into this I'm going to get into
other avenues in which I made money from
YouTube as well and how much I made
through that in just a second but
firstly the thing I find Most
Fascinating about YouTube and why I
chose this platform as my first space
over other social media platforms is
because of the business model firstly
it's a platform where I as a Creator get
paid for creating content and you as a
viewer don't have to pay for it and
secondly you only have to make your
videos once but that video is kind of
like a digital asset in the sense that
will keep making money for you months if
not years after without you having to
put in any more work so that's pretty
different to platforms like Instagram
where your older photos and videos are
basically dead no one sees them unless
they click on your profile and scroll to
the bottom of your page to get to that
content content on YouTube doesn't have
this issue and the YouTube algorithm
will still show and recommend to you
videos from years ago and put it on your
homepage if it's still relevant so that
4000 dollars is just from YouTube
AdSense so the ads that's shown on
YouTube and for a lot of big creators
that only makes up a portion of what
they earn through the platform and
usually it's the smallest income stream
but for me for the last month it has
been my largest income stream the other
common way to make money kind of using
YouTube is through affiliate links so
through the Amazon links I have in my
description box or the other platforms
I've linked through that I've made 90
pounds on Amazon and 35 pounds on or
through other links and the way
affiliate links work is that you don't
have to pay any extra for buying that
product but I get a small Commission
because I recommended it it's another
large source of income which comes
through having a YouTube channel or
YouTube platform is sponsorships this is
essentially when Brands pay you as a
content creator to talk about their
product on your channel for about 45
seconds and the amount that our company
pays changes massively but depending on
who the company is and who the Creator
is and usually we have to sign an ndas
which is a non-disclosure agreement so
we can't actually say how much a company
is paying for a specific deal I'm a
relatively small Channel with 40 000
subscribers and it was around the 20 000
Subs where I started receiving
sponsorship requests I've turned down
most of them and two of the biggest ones
that I've turned down were paying over
four figures had I started this channel
five years ago maybe I would have taken
on both of those sponsorships and I
guess a lot of this comes down to
understanding who you are what values
you stand for and what you want your
channel to represent at the end of the
day and neither of those sponsors
aligned to any of these for me so in
total from sponsorships I have made zero
dollars as of today but another channel
on 40 000 subscribers on YouTube it's
very likely that they would have made
some money from sponsorships so while my
final thoughts on starting a channel and
has it been worth it having an audience
and showing your work online can open up
a lot of opportunities and I do think if
it's something that you're on edge about
just do it get started and upload your
first video as soon as you can I went
from someone who very rarely uses social
media to being full out on YouTube and
it's definitely been worth it one of the
things that stopped a lot of people from
putting themselves online is the idea of
what people think and and what people
will say and even for myself I'm loads
of my friends and family have come
across this YouTube channel and yeah I
think you've got to accept that the
start it might be a bit surprising to
people and you might get laughed at a
few times but people will eventually get
bored of it and my attitude has always
been that as long as you're doing what
you want to do and you're not hurting
anyone else in doing it then don't spend
a second focusing on what other people
on the sidelines are saying it has been
totally worth it in my opinion I was
looking for something I can do to have
more of an impact on individuals whilst
also being paid for it and this has been
just the thing that has married those
two things up and has allowed me to do
that and then it's a very satisfying
feeling when I get a message from
someone saying that they like my content
and that's inspired them to do something
that one message alone outweighs
everything and that's probably the thing
that has kept me going and kept me going
for a year without seeing any results so
if you've been on the edge of starting
something just go for it you won't look
back anyway I hope you've enjoyed this
video and it's inspired you to do
something I've left another video here
on my journey and what I plan to do to
build wealth and now that YouTube is
also one of my income streams and I hope
to see you there"
yPwRr4LRlKw,"hi everyone welcome back if you're new
here I'm Nisha I'm a banker based in the
UK and this is the 40 000 subscriber q a
because I guess that's what one does
when they have a YouTube channel 40 000
of you have joined this channel the last
month which is crazy huge huge thank you
to everyone who has subscribed and has
supported me so in this video I'm
answering questions that were asked off
the back of my last video and through
the comments and through my Instagram
and I've time stamped all the questions
below so you can skip to whichever
question interests you the most yz406
asked what did I study what has my
career look like and where do I work I
studied Finance and Accounting at
University it was a three-year degree
and in my second year of uni I applied
for summer internships mostly for Middle
office functions that can sponsor the
ACA qualification so I got an offer from
Deutsche Bank here's my claim to fame I
made it in the client magazine talking
about how to empower and Inspire
Millennials from that I got a full-time
offer at the bank I was sponsored to
complete an accountancy qualification in
my first three years of working and then
moved to the front office within the
bank and have moved to a few different
organizations since then but I've always
been on the debt side I've got a video
on my channel of what that means
specifically but I don't say where I
work on YouTube because my views are my
own and they don't represent the company
that I work for in anyway bluecrest
Property Group 237a asks how much if any
do you share with your co-workers about
your side hustles I am pretty open about
most of my side hustles because you
don't really know where or what
opportunities it can bring when you
openly speak about some of the stuff
that you're doing and you'll find that
when you do talk to other people about
what you're doing on the side they will
open up and tell you about what they're
doing as well and then it kind of
becomes a really cool exchange of ideas
at least that's what I found there are
specific things that I choose to open up
about and specific things that I don't
even kind of with people outside of work
I'm quite open with the property stuff
I'm doing on the side I I went to grab a
takeaway pizza the other day and ended
up speaking to the owner for ages and
told them what I do and the properties
that I'm working on funny enough he was
looking for a new commercial property to
rent out and I had a tenant that was
applicating and just through that
conversation and opening up and telling
what I'm doing he's now one of the
tenants for a commercial property
aberdal underscore Jen asked have you
ever thought about modeling I'm assuming
you meant in the physical appearance
sense rather than Excel modeling if you
know you know I did model for a period
of time I did a few things whilst I was
at school and then also my first year at
University and then my focus became more
geared towards finance and Business and
Entrepreneurship they also asked do you
come from a background of entrepreneurs
yes so my mom was born in India my dad
in Uganda and they moved to the UK in
the 1970s or early 1980s and basically
starting from scratch my father has
never worked for an organization or for
a corporation they are the OG Hustlers
and I was very fortunate in that sense
growing up we had conversations around
the dinner table or talking about money
talking about business ideas talking
about entrepreneurship and so I think a
lot of who I am and why I have this
Flair to do more than just my day job
has come through what I was surrounded
by growing up and the attitude that my
parents took towards money it's Willie
Lugo asked do you spend time with family
all the time when I'm working I'm just
focusing on working in nothing else but
when I'm not working I completely switch
off I spend time with my parents my
siblings I go out with my partner I know
this channel is about personal finance
about Building Wealth about money but
that's not the only side of me at all
and I strongly believe in balance and
enjoying the journey which may not come
across necessarily in my videos and I'm
thinking about maybe bringing that side
in as well although I don't really know
how interesting it'll be for you guys
zr6507 said what do you know now that
you didn't know before not to look back
so I sometimes still find myself doing
this I sometimes think oh what if I did
this differently how would my life have
changed what if I did this differently
but no actually every single decision I
made has led to today so if I go back
and change something in the past it will
just have a domino effect and change
things in the future and I rather not
take that risk sound Barry asked why did
you start a YouTube channel so I'm going
to read you something from my journal
that I wrote last year before I started
this Channel at the end of every year I
do this like kind of self-auditing and
understanding what I want to do the next
year one of the questions was what would
I want to experience in life if time and
money were not an issue and I wrote
travel the world do all the crazy
Adventures or activities work because I
want to and not because I have to doing
something I really have fun with whilst
impacting and motivating others and
using my core strengths that's a snippet
in the paragraph soon after kind of
doing this little exercise I read this
book which I refer to quite often on
this channel called The Almanac by Naval
rabbit I highly recommend it and in this
book he talks about why starting a
podcast or starting a YouTube channel
can be super beneficial and the Avenues
it can open up and the possibilities
that can lead to that people don't
necessarily actually think of yeah I
just made this channel I know a fair bit
about business about Finance I've done
Finance for years and years and years
and I'm still learning so much so I
thought wanna and I just public
everything I'm doing publicly and at the
same time hopefully other people can get
some inspiration and resonate with bits
and join me on my journey and here we
are how did you get so many subscribers
so quickly so for context I got 40 000
subscribers in a month I'll make a video
on this more specifically for whoever's
interested in growing your channel but
as a quick answer of that it was one of
my videos that were picked up by the
YouTube algorithm actually what's
important than that is the video that
got picked up is the last one I expected
to get picked up it was my day in the
life video which is where I really
leaned into what I do before that I
never really said on this channel what
my job is and I just spoke about
property stuff that's the reason why or
what my focus was initially on this
channel but then when I decided to kind
of open up and erase it and use it as an
opportunity to educate people that's
when people started coming through so my
takeaway from this is don't
underestimate the value you can bring to
the table you don't need to know
everything and no one who starts a
channel does know everything but
everyone does have a story that someone
else can resonate with Sheena C what's
been the hardest thing about starting a
YouTube channel it's generally been
really fun really really fun I've had so
many intangible wins also tangible wins
there have been some days where I
realized how much work still needs to be
done around educating people that woman
can make money they can have Ambitions
they can work in investment Banks and
also be in relationships at the same
time so
yeah a few more things to speak about on
my channel more than that I think on a
personal level what the biggest hurdle
has been for me is to kind of get over
my anxiety I've always been a very
private person which is ridiculous when
you think about it like why would you
then go and start a YouTube channel but
hey that's what I signed up for do you
think trying to grow multiple income
streams together creates distraction and
limits your ability to be the best in
the single Niche most important thing
for me and what I've learned over time
actually is focus really focus on
something and dedicate everything to it
for a specific period of time so I'll
give myself three months or six months
or a predetermined time to do something
and then once that time's up I'll step
back and I'll reassess what the
situation is and be very honest with
myself as to whether it is worth
continuing or whether I should just drop
the thing as hard as that may be and
move on to the next thing so this is my
experience I feel like if you give
everything to a specific task for a
specific amount of time you can get that
thing to a stage where different tasks
can then be outsourced and then you can
move and focus onto other things even
now I have so many ideas on what I want
to do next as I follow up from YouTube
and I'll be talking you through all my
ideas in another video as well but I've
made a clear plan for what my next year
is going to look like and what I'm going
to focus at at what point or at what
month I do get annoyed to myself because
I feel like I'm quite a creative person
I'm and my mind is kind of chaotic I
have so many different ideas and I need
to kind of bring myself in but I realize
that taking on all those ideas at once
will only compromise the amount you can
give to a single one and if I'm not
focusing 100 on one project then someone
else says okay Zia 6507 another question
if I had 100K how would I invest it how
do you balance saving up money for your
next property and investing in stocks or
other asset classes so my Investment
Portfolio is made up of property of
index funds a few stocks and some gold I
have restrictions on what I can invest
in so whilst there are things that I
would like to invest in I have to get
approval to do so out of the three asset
class I invest largely or a bulk of that
in property I've been doing that for
years and I find that the returns are
lump sum and it's not as much of a
long-term view as the stock market it is
I also do lock away a specific amount
every month into index funds and that's
kind of my long-term wealth generator
and just a side note I personally also
invest a lot in myself I know that
sounds a bit cliche but I've bought a
fair amount of online courses the first
one I did was a property course so
that's also what constitutes to part of
my investments I guess I'm aware that
there are so many different Industries
and careers I can go into but how can I
explore my options as soon as you can
get involved in work experiences and
unpaid experiences and take on any
opportunity you can to just to learn and
see part of an industry any industry the
mistake I see a lot of people make is
that they want to get experience in
something but they also want to get paid
for it straight away if it's an amazing
opportunity then that experience alone
can multiply the earnings in the long
run but they stop themselves at the
first hurdle just by thinking okay how
can I make a short term how can I make a
quick Buck it's important to take a
long-term View and think okay all these
experiences that I'm gaining in the
short term will lead to multiplying my
earnings in the future to give you an
example this girl called Deborah she
reached out to me and said she likes my
content and she's came to work my
thumbnails and I also what her price is
and she said she doesn't have a
portfolio but wants to do it for free
because she wants to just learn and get
involved so she can build out her
portfolio from now we speak all the time
I get her involved in other projects
behind the scenes on Youtube and she
works on a number of different fun
things with me just through that first
interaction and her willingness to show
me that she's really Keen to learn and
willing to do anything and provide
something without thinking of money
straight away she has been able to see
so much more and learn so much more than
what a straight payment every month
would have given up Ravi underscore 10
underscore savani asked how important is
a good Network in work or in business
one of the first things someone said to
me when I entered the workforce is it's
not what you know it's who you know and
yeah I largely believe that it's true to
some extent but I'd almost turn that in
its head and say it's not who you know
is who knows you who knows what you're
working on who knows what you're
investing in the projects you're
involved in a lot of this helps create
your reputation both in corporate world
and outside when it comes to business
ventures bootstrapping getting investors
and involved one of my favorite quotes
is also great minds discuss ideas
average Minds discuss events small minds
discuss people so I always try to
associate and be around people who are
discussing the next business venture
discussing new ideas over anything else
I hope I pronounced that right asked I
read three to five books in the last
four weeks about money and I'm going
crazy I can't sleep anymore I can't
focus on my studies after knowing this
please can you guide me the next step
should I wait until I graduate and work
and then start my own business I want to
say to you and anyone else who is at
University or at college to enjoy those
days they don't come back you have the
rest of your life to make money join
those societies learn a new hobby you
can do some work experience internships
over the summer experiment with
different things and test out different
businesses so don't fret about making
money it's you've got your whole life to
do it one Laura Channel asked is it
possible to manage a relationship when
you have more than a job or maybe you're
still studying more than possible I
don't myself I'm in a relationship and I
do quite a lot on this side I like to
think of different areas of your life as
spinning plates you have a relationship
play you have a career play you have a
spiritual plate you have all these
different plates for different things
that are important to you in your life
and if you try and keep them all
spinning all at once guaranteed they're
going to fall one smash so it's about
focusing on the right one at the right
time and understanding that it may be
that one other plate has to slow down
whilst you keep the other one spinning
so it's about checking in with yourself
every now and then and making sure you
are happy with what is spinning fast
what's spinning slow and if you want to
reassess that there are some other
questions that I haven't answered that
have been asked on my last video as well
and I'll go back and comment on those
questions specifically I just don't
think that there were ones that other
people may be interested in hearing
thank you for watching anyway more
interesting comment coming through this

JmvDUYR1VQg,"in this video I'm going to share with you six of 
my all-time favorite personal finance books that  
have had the biggest impact to my life over the 
last few years and have completely changed my  
mindset when it comes to money and time I'll share 
a key takeaway from each of these so you have  
a little preview of what you're getting yourself 
into number one I will teach you the whole premise  
of this book is that it's not about the money you 
make it's about the money you keep and what you do  
with that money that will really make a difference 
you could be earning 70 80 grand a year but if you  
don't know how to manage your money you will 
just be living paycheck to paycheck one of the  
things I find most frustrating when I hear people 
from Finance backgrounds speak to people from  
non-finance backgrounds is their inability to use 
simple words when explaining something Sethi gets  
this bang on he uses the terms that are very 
understandable to the everyday Layman from all  
walks of life the device is pretty unconventional 
he says buy all the lattes you want use credit  
cards to your advantage and don't think about the 
pennies but Focus instead on the big ticket items  
the chapters have very clear actions on things 
you could do like where you can open up your bank  
accounts how to get out of debt as well as things 
like how to bucket your money between fixed costs  
between savings between investing and guilt-free 
spending if you're looking for a very practical  
and actionable book he's your man next up we have 
the four hour work week this book has been very  
pivotal to my life if you have an interest in 
entrepreneurship or in business in the slightest  
sense you really have to read this book ever 
since I've got this book I've kind of formed a  
very clear picture on exactly what I'm aiming for 
and also how I'm going to get there and it's the  
kind of book I do wish I read like 10 years ago 
I would have done many things differently this  
book has inspired me to think out the box and 
question everything I know about productivity  
about time and about money most of us follow the 
same routine where we go to school we graduate we  
get a great job we work super hard and make loads 
of money and then eventually retire but this book  
questions that whole system why should we be 
working until we're 65 70 when we can't even  
enjoy that money will have the ability to enjoy 
that money as much but instead take those 20 30  
years after retirement and spread them throughout 
our life instead he calls us mini retirements he  
also alludes to this concept of the new Rich 
which is when you have total control of when  
you work and where you work from and he explains 
how the new Rich generally have Auto automated  
streams of passive income that allow them to 
work as much as they want or as little as they  
want from anywhere they want to work from and in 
this book he includes a lot of practical steps for  
creating passive income streams that allow you to 
live the new Rich lifestyle he also gives tips to  
office employees on how they can live the new Rich 
lifestyle while still keeping their corporate job  
I received a few comments on the back of another 
video that I made as to how I balance the side  
hustles whilst working a full-time job in banking 
and a big reason why is down to the learnings  
of this book it has so many tips and tricks on 
being efficient things like Outsourcing to remote  
workers automated things batching different tasks 
so you could churn out things churn out more stuff  
and the reason why I've been able to play around 
with so many ideas without burning out is because  
I've taken on so many of the ideas that Tim 
Ferriss talks about in this book next up we have  
Rich Dad Poor Dad I know you've probably heard 
of this one time and time again but it is the  
number one top selling personal finance Book for a 
reason and I've put this one in because it really  
was a Tipping Point for me from having an employee 
mindset and thinking about purely income to having  
a business mindset and thinking about generating 
and Building Wealth and the storyline is that  
there are two dads Robert has a rich dad and a 
Poor Dad and they have very different mindsets  
in the book Robert explores the mindset that these 
two dads had when it came to money the dad who had  
impeccable grades qualifications on qualifications 
a high-paying job but was living paycheck to  
paycheck was a poor dad and the rich dad who came 
from a completely different background and had a  
completely different mindset when it came to money 
the way he spoke about it the way he treated it  
the way he used it and the way he made more money 
from it and in this book you take on the Journey  
of these two individuals and their mindset when 
it comes to finances and wealth building and by  
the end of the book it's so clear as to what 
makes one of them rich and the other one poor  
school doesn't teach us the things that I read in 
this book while you shouldn't just stop at your  
day job the tax implications of an entrepreneur 
versus an employee financial literacy as a whole  
and the most important takeaway from this book 
is the way he describes asset and liabilities  
the wealthy the buy assets whereas the poor and 
the middle class by liabilities liabilities cost  
money to buy and they cost money to maintain 
whereas on the other hand every dollar you  
invest into an asset becomes an employee that is 
working for you when you're not working the goal  
is to get your income as high above your expenses 
as possible so that you can invest the disposable  
income you can invest the difference into assets 
which create more income and then there's this  
beautiful cycle of increasing cash flow increasing 
assets increasing cash flow increasing assets next  
up we have the cash flow quadrant this is kind 
of like a sequel to Rich Dad report ad but it's  
a bit more sophisticated and in this book Robert 
goes through the key steps that him and his wife  
took to go from being homeless to Building Wealth 
and retiring young in this book Robert draws into  
the four sections or the quadrants of different 
ways we can earn money and he categorizes that  
into four ways employees self-employed business 
and investors most of us are conditioned to become  
employees or self-employed and that's the way 
the system has been created we don't have lessons  
on business us or in finance not at school at 
least I didn't and no one learns how to become  
an entrepreneur or how to invest their money but 
Robert says that true wealth come from BB and the  
eye segment because of the freedom it gives you 
and it's all about building passive income so  
since I've graduated I've always had a foot in the 
e-contrant I'm trying more and more to explore the  
other quadrants and if I look at the people around 
me and those that have kind of made it in terms of  
freedom and passive income are those in the B and 
the I cash flow quadrants so this book is about  
being intentional with which quadrant you want 
to be in and just because you're in one now it  
doesn't mean that you can't make that shift and 
also doesn't mean that you can't make that shift  
overnight it just means using your time and money 
wisely so you can cross over to another quadrant  
if that's what you want to do and this book gives 
you all the skills and the mindset shifts that you  
need to make to make that switch next up we have 
Think and Grow Rich there's a lot of controversy  
around this book and that's a bit kind of fluffy a 
bit Airy fairy and kind of like the secret The Law  
of Attraction but I personally am a huge believer 
in what the mind can believe if the mind can't  
achieve with the right actions of course to back 
that and I feel like the first step in getting  
anywhere is to have this kind of outrageous level 
of self-belief that you can do anything and over  
the course of 20 years the author Napoleon Hill 
interviewed a bunch of people that had built huge  
fortunes from scratch and he found common things 
amongst all of them and he basically outlines in  
this book the blueprint for how anyone can 
become rich this book makes you realize that  
it doesn't take money to make money necessarily 
it does take the right mindset and he says that  
getting rich requires three key things number 
one desire number two a plan and number three  
an unwavering focus and these three things will 
unleash the opportunities you need to make money  
people think that it's all the latest things the 
latest gadgets the most revolutionary ideas you  
have to do but it really comes down to these three 
Timeless principles that stand the test of time  
it might be a bit fluffy for some people but money 
and wealth really is about the mindset and less in  
my opinion about knowing the complicated Financial 
things and the financial actions that you need  
to do this book rewire is your brain and makes 
you think completely differently about finances  
in a way that makes the whole making money and 
managing your money is so interesting next up we  
have lean in by Cheryl Sandberg the books I've 
mentioned so far are about managing your money  
making money grow for you in a way where you can 
secure Independence and secure Financial abundance  
managing your money is one part of it but to 
really Propel and speed up that process you've  
got to manage your money manage your expenses but 
also increase your income increase your revenue  
and for a lot of people watching this I imagine 
our day job is a huge source of that income it's  
the foundation that's why the next book I want 
to recommend is Lena by Cheryl Sandberg a lot of  
what we see and hear about today is about owning 
a business about being an entrepreneur or whatever  
but the reality is a lot of us do work in day jobs 
and so we need to know how to make the most out of  
our situation and make sure we are getting the 
pay we deserve and the money we deserve for the  
work that we're putting in this book provides a 
lot of advice on how to climb up that corporate  
ladder and encourages women to take more risks 
be more ambitious in the professional goals gain  
confidence demand more and generally gun for 
those leadership positions but this book is  
both for women and for men the men that want to 
support their Partners in achieving their goals  
and understanding what they have to do I want to 
do more book reviews on non-personal finance books  
as well there's quite a few that have completely 
changed the way I think and if you're interested  
in that then let me know I'll make more of 
those videos I am also going to record a q  
a next week if you have any questions that you 
want to ask pop them in the comments below or  
DM them over on my Instagram and I'll get them 
answered thank you so much for watching don't

iGyoPF-jOHw,"hi guys welcome back in this video I'm
going to share seven common myths about
the stock market this video will help if
you're looking to get started with
investing and you want to know which
pitfalls to avoid or if you have already
started investing and you've lost money
then you may well have fallen into the
Trap of one of these myths and the
earlier you spot it the better let's go
for it myth number one you need to be
clever to invest there is a
misconception that you need to spend
hours and hours and hours researching
stocks analyzing these companies
understanding balance sheets if you want
to start investing and the world of
Finance is full of a lot of jargon that
I admit can be quite intimidating when
you're not in the field and sometimes I
do actually think is this jargon just
there to stop people going out and
investing and taking control of their
own personal finances is the struggle
there to make people feel like they
don't really understand investing so
they either stay clear or they just pay
someone else to do it for them because
that's far easier and fair enough I do
think that there is definitely space for
professionals to exist in this field or
in any field but there is an element of
it that you should know how to handle
and know to understand yourself it is
personal finance you don't need to or
have to go to a financial advisor to
start investing you don't need to know
all the ins and the outs to understand
everything in a financial statement to
start investing and by and large it's
not about doing an extensive amount of
research on stock after stock after
stock or having a good instinct or
knowing what's happening in every single
industry is about kind of understanding
the basic principles of investing and
getting started and then having the
discipline to keep it going myth number
two if the market has crashed you've
lost your money if you've invested in
the stock market and your positions are
down today 20 30 40 you haven't lost
that money and you won't lose that money
until you pull that money out and
solidify your losses when you have
invested in the stock market and the
market drops you need to kind of refrain
from doing anything refrain from selling
like stay away from the news stop
reading every single narrative stop
checking in on your Investments every
second because all of this will make you
want to react and pull your money out at
the end of the day assuming you haven't
just gone and invested in something
stupid that you didn't even understand
even if you have lost a lot of money
there's a good chance that the stock
market will eventually recover and you
will make back those losses the stock
market it's like a financial health
monitor if the company is alive and
kicking the share price will be having
these daily fluctuations and generally
you will see it have a upward trajectory
if you look at the crashes in history
you've got the 1929 crash the 1973 crash
the.com crash and then the last two
crashes that we saw in 2008 and 2020
every single time the market has bounced
back and there has been a long-term
upward Trend so it's worth looking back
at what happened and taking that into
account the next time you lose money in
quotation marks because you don't
actually lose money until you pull that
money out myth number three percentage
gains equals percentage loss people make
this mistake very very often and
understanding percentage gains and
losses over time is super important if
you're looking to get into investing or
are already investing as it helps you
determine your rate of return or your
net gain or your loss over a period of
time so what a lot of people do wrong is
thinking that the percentage gain is
equivalent to the percentage loss so say
if you were down 50 yesterday but you
aren't 50 today you may think okay
you're now back at where you were two
days ago but this isn't actually correct
if you started with a hundred dollars
two days ago and you lose fifty percent
of that then you have fifty dollars now
if you gain 50 on that fifty dollars
that you have you're now at 75 so our
minds can easily trick us but if our
stock has fallen by 50 then it will need
to increase by 100 to get to that same
price as before myth number four you
need to buy more stocks to diversify
rumor has it the more stocks you earn
the more Diversified your portfolio will
be whilst this is true to a certain
extent the key is in how uncorrelated
these stocks are to each other so if you
had invested in all Leisure and all
travel companies before 2020 then you'll
put folio probably took a massive
hammering during the pandemic correlated
stocks tend to move up and down together
but aren't correlated stocks tend to
move in opposite directions and a
portfolio so of all travel stocks for
example wouldn't be very Diversified
because they would like to all move in
tandem with each other so the key is to
offset any losses by spreading out money
across multiple sectors and across
multiple asset classes so stocks bonds
Metals real estate so you have enough
chances to make money in any kind of
economic environment myth number five
you need to buy the trough despite what
many YouTube or Tick Tock self Acclaim
to stop Traders say or may try to tell
you nobody actually knows what the
market is going to do timing the market
is incredibly difficult and actually it
takes two decisions to be made correctly
so when when to get out and when to buy
back in hypothetically it's super easy
to say our buy-in when the shares are at
rock bottom but no one knows when Rock
Bottom is it's only after Rock Bottom
passes or has passed that we know that
that was rock bottom Insight is 2020. so
if you are seeing a market crash or a
market correction and it's likely that
it will continue for a few months ahead
then it's a good idea to dollar cost
average your investments into it so for
example instead of putting a hundred
dollars lump sum into the stock market
all at once splitting out that 100 into
smaller pieces and putting it into the
stock market staggered over a period of
time that way you kind of average out
where you are buying at also I hear some
people saying that they are waiting for
a stock price to come down to a certain
level before they go in and invest there
is no gravitational force to pull stocks
back to even all those stocks do
sometimes undergo a correction the point
is that the stock market as a whole is
meant to be a reflection of the company
so if you find a great firm a solid
credit strong financials run by accident
managers there is no reason why the
stock will not continue to rise so there
is no point kind of waiting for it to
fall before going in it may just be that
will continue going up up so instead of
trying to time the market the best route
for long-term investing in the stock
market is to just stay the course I've
always being wrapped up in the
day-to-day news and the cycles and just
let your initial investment strategies
play out number six buying just because
the price has fallen when it comes to a
market crash or a market correction most
stocks go on sale but buying every stock
simply because the price has fallen is
not a good strategy so suppose you're
looking at two stocks stock stock a
reached an all-time high last year
around 50 that has since Fallen to ten
dollars per share on the other side you
have Stock B and it's a smaller company
but it's recently gone from five dollars
to ten dollars per share which stock
would you buy the majority of investors
would choose stock a so the stock that
has fallen from fifty dollars to ten
dollars because they believe it will
eventually make its way back up to those
levels again but thinking this way is
one of the cardinal sins of investing
and we often do this without realizing
research shows that people are more
likely to buy something when it is on
sale than if it was marketed at that
discounted price to start with and
that's because our brains are wired to
think that the quality and the value of
the item that we are getting is actually
closer to the original higher advice so
we think that we're getting a bargain
but price is only a small part of the
equation the goal is not to just buy
stocks that are heavily discounted for
the sake of it but instead buy high
quality growth companies at a reasonable
price myth number seven the stock market
has an obligation whether you're a
beginner new to investing with a couple
of hundred quid in savings or you're an
expert who has millions lying around by
the way the stock market has no
obligation to you we invest in the stock
market with this expectation that these
stocks will increase over time or will
give us a return but there is no
guarantee and that's why rule number one
before you start investing is to always
have an emergency fund in place this
should be at least three to six months
of your basic living expenses just kept
to the side before you start investing
that money that way if anything
unexpected happens so you lose your job
your car breaks down your boiler breaks
you at least have funds that you can
cover on a rainy day and you won't need
to tap into your Investment Portfolio or
sell your shares at a loss just because
you didn't have that emergency see Fund
in place so hopefully this gives you
some ideas on pitfalls to avoid if
you're looking to invest in the stock
market thank you for watching don't
forget to subscribe if you haven't
already and hope to see you in one of my
next videos"
NW2Y4YwqZMs,"hey guys welcome back to the channel in
this video we're going through the five
biggest money mistakes that I made in
the last 10 years let's go for it number
one buying that car so as soon as I got
a job in banking it really didn't take
me very long to spend my first couple of
paychecks on a car that was out of my
price range there's a reason why I
preach on my channel not to spend more
than you can afford on liabilities if
you're not yet in a position to do so
and it's because I've made this mistake
and hindsight is 20 20 so I can sit here
and tell you from my own experience
don't bother with it it's just not worth
it the short-term joy that I may bring
you is not worth putting your financial
freedom on hold for what I should have
done instead of having spent those
paychecks on a liability which is
something that decreases in value over
time is instead having spent that money
on an asset that can generate more money
and generate wealth for me in the long
term and this is what I do now if you
watch my video so you know that I
heavily invest in properties and the
idea is for me to eventually have enough
assets that I can pay for those
liabilities and give me passive income
in the long term I'm very happy to delay
that spending on a few nice things on
random splurges right now until I've got
other things and more important things
for me like Financial Freedom and
flexibility for myself and those around
me in check first so now I really know
the importance of understanding the
difference between an asset and
liability and I see a lot of people
think that they're buying an asset but
actually they're buying a liability or
even the other way buying a liability
that's actually an asset which isn't
such a bad place to be in I recently saw
a YouTuber talk about how you shouldn't
buy Rolexes full stop as it's a
liability but if you dig into that a bit
further you find that there are specific
Rolexes that I have held the value or
gone up in value over time and the same
goes with specific artwork so it really
is about educating yourself and there's
no kind of generalizing all items into
one category but being mindful of the
information fed into you and only
spending large amount ounce of money on
things that you really understand my
second mistake is spending too much time
focusing on savings so I went through a
phase in my 20s having this mindset
where I just needed to save save save
and save as much as I can people often
think that they need to save as much as
they can now so that they can retire
early and be financially free but the
issue with spending less purely for the
reason to say that not do anything else
and retire early is that that money you
save is going to run out pretty quickly
especially because of inflation whereas
what you really want to do is spend less
and below your means now so that you can
invest that money because this will keep
your cash and income at a steady place
and sustain your lifestyle going forward
when you do eventually choose to retire
now I don't really focus on saving the
five dollars the ten dollars here and
there instead I focus on getting a
really good deal on the big ticket items
on things like securing a good mortgage
rate and things that make a sizable
difference to my living expenses then
spending the rest of my time and the
rest of my energy to increase my
earnings potential so that I can invest
more because again there is no cap to
the side there are no limit invitations
number three buy once cry once it took
me a while to understand this but if you
think long term this will be a phrase
that you really appreciate you'll spend
more money on day one they will save you
more money and a lot more stress further
down the lines I would cheap out on a
lot of things and I will sacrifice on
quality for the sake of saving a few
quid here and there only to find that
that item didn't last very long and I'll
need to Fork out more money to get a new
one so when I first moved into this
apartment and had to spend a lot of
money all at once on different items of
furniture and different household
appliances all the stuff that I bought
well and didn't cheap out on has lasted
me and all the stuff that I did cheap
out on and tried to save a couple of
quid here and there has costed me more
money in the long term so my better
mattress yes it did hurt my soul in
paying a little bit more than I needed
but a few years down the line it's
lasted me I love it I don't plan on
changing it anytime soon whereas my
Hoover on the other side I've had to
upgrade it twice over it's broken down
on me multiple times it's just not worth
the additional stress and the additional
expenses I had to go through instead of
just paying it buying it properly the
first time around if you spend the money
properly the first time and don't mind
forking out a bit more in exchange for
durability and quality then it's very
likely you will make up that money in
the long run number four not investing
earlier so I started making money when I
was 19. uh with my first job in retail
but it wasn't until I was 24 that I
actually started investing that money
and I wish I started earlier obviously
because of the power of compounding
which I've spoken about on this channel
is the fact that the earlier you start
investing your money the quicker it's
going to just grow exponentially for you
but even more than that it's because it
would have instilled the discipline and
the habits I needed for investing from
earlier on so when I started making
proper money at the age of 21 it took me
a further three years to actually
understand investing and get comfortable
with the idea of investing I was scared
to lose money I didn't know which
accounts to use I didn't know what to
invest in I didn't even know what
investing was and if I just figured all
that stuff out earlier I would have been
able to hit the ground running and put a
decent amount of money and straight away
when I actually started earning at 21
years old properly if you want to get
into investing and you don't know where
to start then I've got another video on
that as well but my advice to anyone who
hasn't yet started investing it's still
worth putting kind of ten dollars or
Twenty Dollars into an investment
account because then at least you have
the account you've verified it you
understand the basic knowledge of
investing so that when you do eventually
start making money you don't waste any
more time and you start investing
straight away a bit of a disclaimer to
this point if you are on a low income
salary and you're kind of struggling to
make ends meet then just know that
investing in the stock market will only
get you so far and it is a long-term
game if you only have a certain amount
of money that you're able to save you
want to be investing in yourself and
educating yourself around financial
literacy and to increase your earnings
growth potential first at the very first
point this is a better investment than
investing in the stock market in my
opinion number five the ant versus the
graph software I'm going to do something
a bit different on this one and I'm
going to add a mistake that I don't want
to make rather than one that I have
already made and I'm adding this one in
here for those of you that are also on a
similar journey to me to Achieve
Financial Freedom and just as a kind of
reminder in the book die with xero the
author Bill Perkins starts by telling a
story about an ant and a grasshopper he
says that the ant the ant works all
summer long to store food and to gather
food for the winter but the
happy-go-lucky grasshopper and start
contrast spends that same time playing
around having a laugh having fun and so
that when winter did finally arrive the
ants arrived and the grasshopper starved
to death brutal but now let's replace
food for money you'd think that the
moral of the story is work hard be
consistent and save up instead of just
lazing around and having fun all the
time but enter Bill Perkins the author
who describes this perfectly and asks
whether it is actually the right way to
go so of course saving up some food is a
pretty good idea but did the ant really
even get to play at all during its short
life so Bill reckons that most of us
stay in this ant mode for way too long
optimizing our life is for work and for
saving money even once we are
financially secure either because it
feels safe or it just feels like it's
the right thing to do but actually maybe
the moment we are financially secure or
in a place where we feel like we're able
to give ourselves some flexibility and
are on the right path to create a life
that we want we should start focusing on
our quality of life because money isn't
an end in itself and for me a big point
in my life is to accumulate fulfilling
experiences and fulfilling memories and
in an Ideal World it'll be amazing we'll
just trade our life energy for these
amazing experiences but in reality we
have something coming in between and
that is the fact that we need to also
make money to survive and then have
those experiences so it really is about
getting the balance right and not
chasing a forever moving goal post in a
way that you kind of forget to enjoy the
here and now so those are my five money
mistakes or mistakes I don't want to
make I hope you enjoyed it if you did
enjoy this I've got a few other videos
I'll link here that you might also enjoy
hopefully see you in one of them"
ogOIoYh0b38,"hi guys welcome back to the channel in this video 
I'm going to go through the 10 things which I've  
stopped buying as we've already spoken about I'm 
not a big believer in Saving but I am a believer  
in spending below your means and saving will only 
get you so far but spending less so that you can  
use that money to invest and work and grow for 
you will make all the difference cutting out  
these things has left me with so much more money 
every month without having to sacrifice on my  
quality of life let's get into it number one or 
books I read a lot and I think reading is super  
important and it's a great financial investment 
to increase your human capital and your knowledge  
and that is something that no one can take away 
from you material items can go out of fashion  
they can be stolen looks fade but knowledge once 
you've acquired it that's yours to keep it will  
it'll always stay with you so now what I do is 
I keep my all-time favorite books in a hard copy  
um on my bookshelf and then the ones that I know 
that I won't be reading again and again and again  
I either Buy on my Kindle or I rent it for free 
through my local library on an app called Libby  
number two a brand new car if you don't have money 
for it just don't buy it the second you put your  
key in the ignition and drive that car out of the 
showroom it loses 10 of its fat and average brand  
new car will lose a further 60 by its third 
year I know some people like the feeling of  
having a brand new car but is it really worth 
that additional amount of money at this point  
in your life or can you hold off to invest that 
money into an asset that will generate the cash  
flow to buy that new car later on in your life 
if that's what you want number three souvenirs  
I really love traveling flights hotels making 
memories these are all things that I'll be buying  
more of but why I've stopped buying is souvenirs 
from every trip more than a waste of money it  
also massively Cutters up my living space I live 
in a two-bedroom apartment with a kitchen that's  
the size of a shoe box anyway so the last thing I 
want is shot glasses from every city I've been to  
overflowing from my cupboards if you really want 
to kind of remember a trip then write in a journal  
I've made an online Journal slash Vlog and I've 
been writing in it after every holiday that I've  
been on since 2016 and I just read through it 
before recording this video and it brought back  
so many more memories than any souvenir there ever 
could number four buying the updated version the  
rate in which new technology comes out way exceeds 
our actual need to replace them but regardless  
of this we still do keep buying it I've actually 
found that the more I have of a particular thing  
the less additional happiness it gives me so 
when I first got the Apple watch there was a  
big jump in my happiness and going from no Apple 
watch to having an Apple Watch it was worth the  
money I felt healthier I felt happier with all 
the workout prompts it did the job that I was  
looking for and then a year later a new version 
came out and I spent a few hundred quid more to  
get the upgrade and that maybe five percent 
increase in happiness that I got from getting  
a slightly better version just didn't correlate to 
the amount of money I spent on it so now whenever  
I think we're upgrading something I always ask 
myself is it really worth spending that 100 000  
quid more to upgrade the specific thing or should 
I rather spend that money on a new experience or a  
new item that will correlate more to the amount 
of happiness I get from it number five items on  
sale there's a difference between buying something 
on sale and buying something because it's on sale  
sales can seem like a great way to save money 
at first because when stores do these 20 off  
30 off 40 off sales they're just actually using 
a psychological trick to make you justify that  
spending in your head if there's a jacket that 
you were going to buy anyway and now it's on  
sale from 200 down to 140 then yeah you've saved 
sixty dollars but if you're buying it because it's  
on sale then you've got to look at it like you're 
140 out of pocket sales are just a way of buying  
things that you wouldn't have otherwise bought 
and remember it's you against these multi-billion  
dollar organizations with huge marketing budgets 
behind them number six investing in things that  
I don't understand this isn't one that I stopped 
buying but it is one that I've stopped putting my  
money in and it's things I don't understand a lot 
of people put their money into Investments without  
really understanding what they're investing in 
it and even if you do have a financial advisor  
you should have a basic level of understanding 
in where your money is going whether it's ethical  
whether you actually want to invest in that thing 
because no one would care about your money and  
where it's going as much as you will number seven 
and fast fashion I mentioned in one of my other  
videos how I haven't bought an item of clothing 
in the last six months I didn't think this was  
anything surprising but it seems to be long story 
short I used to shop at all the fast fashion shops  
you can think of Forever 21 misguided boohoo 
whatever but when I look at my closet today none  
of those fast fashion items that I bought are 
still in there I used to spend a lot of money  
on stuff that I'd wear a few times and then I'd 
get rid of them because it started frailing or it  
went out of fashion now I've learned my lesson and 
when it comes to clothing I'm so much more about  
quality over quantity if something feels really 
good and it's really comfortable then I'd buy it  
even if I'm spending a bit more money than I would 
have if that was a fast fashion item at Forever  
21 or something also I find that having fewer 
clothes just frees up my mental space I don't have  
to spend much time deciding what I'm going to wear 
and I have like three different tops that I choose  
between when I'm recording my YouTube videos and 
it's just one less thing that I have to worry  
about number eight anything high maintenance so 
that's getting my nails done getting my eyelashes  
done getting my hair dyed it's all too high 
maintenance and it just doesn't happen anymore  
and a big part of why I don't get this done is 
also because of the time it takes to get those  
things done when I'm getting my nails done I can't 
do anything else at the same time I can't get my  
work done at the same time so it's for me it's not 
only the price I pay for getting these things done  
but I also think about it as a time value of me 
sacrificing an hour that I could have spent on  
doing something else that would get me a greater 
return just FYI I don't think of this time dollar  
value with everything in my life like seeing my 
friends family going on date night that would be a  
bit outrageous but it is with things that I think 
are just a waste of time number nine a prenup this  
Christmas I'll be signing up to a prenup which 
is a no unnecessary present pact usually during  
Christmas we give presents to an extended list of 
people but right now we're going through a cost of  
living crisis and expecting to see the longest 
recession in the UK to date and honestly I feel  
like holiday gifts are things that we just do out 
of habit and very often I get things that I don't  
even want or need but then I feel obliged to give 
it back to that person and vice versa according to  
find a dot com the average British adult would 
Fork out 548 pounds of Christmas gifts and the  
average American will spend 990 dollars and I'm 
no Grinch but I think there are three ways to give  
back which will still be very much appreciated 
and that way maybe other people won't feel like  
they need to spend on you just for the sake of it 
either my overall mindset for spending is that I  
have absolutely no problem in spending things 
that really bring me joy and value but I don't  
want to spend on things just because it's out of 
habit or because it's based on my ego and feeling  
like I need to impress people I think if you cut 
out on those two things then you'll be in a pretty  
good place financially with all of these things I 
like to kind of look at my financial decisions in  
terms of trade-offs so if I'm buying a liability 
or something that is going to decrease in value  
over time is that extra amount of money that I'm 
going to pay for this thing worth the trade-off  
of potentially sacrificing my Financial Freedom so 
spending maybe an extra five grand on a better car  
right now might not feel like it's a big deal but 
if it's a choice between spending that five grand  
on a nicer car versus spending that 5 Grant on 
an investment or to educate yourself or to build  
wealth that could potentially change your life 
then is it really worth it if you want to know  
how much I spend each month then I've got another 
video here that I'll link thank you so much for  
watching don't forget to subscribe if you haven't 
already and hopefully see you in my next video"
vVYENjyRjdE,"there's always that age-old
controversial question as to whether you
should buy or rent and on one side you
might think that buying a home right now
isn't a good idea given the rising
interest rates making the cost of buying
a home far more expensive than it was
before but on the other side of the coin
you might also be thinking that renting
might not be the best option given rents
have been surging and you're essentially
just throwing money down the drain so
instead it's better to buy the house and
start building Equity I've been
investing in property for the past six
years so in this video I thought it'd be
a good idea to go into a deep dive
analysis on all the factors that you can
consider and that come into play in a
typical buyer versus rent situation and
hopefully by the end of this video you
can make a more informed decision as to
which one you want to do this will be
one of a series of property stuff on
this channel I'm going to link all the
websites and sources that I've used
below so that you can just use them for
your own numbers and your own analysis
as well to compare apples to apples I
started by finding this house on sale on
Rightmove is in Aylesbury which is just
outside of London and it's priced for
325 Grand I chose this home because it's
a standard three-bedroom home and and
it's close to the average house price in
the UK to then find a rental comparable
I search for a similar home in the
neighborhood and found this home which
is renting for 1 450 pounds a month so
let's assume you can choose to buy this
house for 325 Grand or you can choose to
rent the home for 1 450 pounds a month
so first let's break down the full cost
of renting versus buying this home and
the things you need to consider let's
start with the financial costs if you're
renting this property then the financial
cost is pretty simple it's the amount of
rent that you're paying to live there
which in this case is 1 450 pounds a
month but this is only the price for the
first month and doesn't include
inflation in the subsequent years so
let's calculate that using two
assumptions the first that you're going
to rent the place for five years which
is just above the average rental period
in the UK and secondly let's assume that
on average the inflation rate over the
next five years is three percent so
assuming the rental will increase in
line with the three percent average
inflation this means that even though we
started renting for 1 450 pounds a month
as rents rise over time you'll end up
paying over 1 1 680 pounds a month
towards the nwf5 so on average the
inflation adjusted rent for the
five-year period is
1565 pounds a month other factors that
you may also want to consider depending
on whether your landlord includes this
in the rent payments or charges this
separately and that includes things like
utility bills and the council tax but
given in this instance they're not
included I'll be excluding both of these
costs from both scenarios to keep it
simple so now let's look at the cost of
buying let's take the average down
payment for a home in the UK which would
be 15 of the purchase price this can be
20 it can be 10 I'm just taking the
average at the moment assuming 15 down
payment on a 325 Grand home that's 48
750 pounds this is money that you're
putting into the equity of the home the
second thing we need to consider are the
closing costs these are the things that
we pay one off to complete the
transaction when we think of buying a
home most of us just think of the
purchase price of the house but there
are closing fees that we have to pay on
top includes things like property tax
which in the UK okay a stamp Duty and
that's the money you essentially pay to
the government for buying the property
this is what the stamp Duty looks like
for those living in the UK and then you
have lawyer fees and these are the fees
for the solicitor to look at all the
documentation the title The Deeds make
sure there's nothing wrong with that and
then you also have to pay for the
valuation fees which you pay to the
mortgage lender to Value the property
and all of that good stuff and that's
kind of a rule of thumb all of these
costs total out to you can expect around
five percent of the purchase price so in
this scenario that adds a further 60 250
pounds to buy the home the rest of the
money to buy this home comes from a
mortgage or a bank loan and let's assume
an average interest for a five-year
fixed is six percent at the moment which
is a lot higher than it was last year at
this rate our monthly mortgage payment
will be
1780 pounds a month this amount is
partly used towards paying off your
interest but also towards paying off the
principal of the property and so you're
gradually adding to your net worth
unlike when you rent where the money is
just going to your landlord to pay off
their mortgage Plus perhaps an
additional profit for that on top of
this it's very likely that you'll have
some sort of repair and maintenance
costs which most people forget to
include and there is kind of a rule of
thumb that you should calculate one
percent of the property price per year
to cover all sorts of Maintenance and
repairs like roof repairs the boiler
braking this one percent can depend on a
number of factors if you're buying an
old home a new home a home that's in
need of a lot of Maintenance and
refurbishment but this is a high level
number that you could assume now what's
really interesting here is that the
total monthly payments to rent this
property is actually lower than the
monthly payments to buy this property in
the current market in a normal Market in
most scenarios you would expect this to
be reversed but in the current market
the rising interest rates have increased
so fast and whilst rents are also
increasing they haven't caught up with
the rising costs of owning a home right
now the next thing you want to consider
are the opportunity costs and this is
what most people don't actually consider
when evaluating whether to buy or rent a
home if I'm choosing to buy in most
decent cities it is safe to assume that
the house price will grow in value over
time so say this house appreciate shapes
by five percent annual growth then over
time in five years this 325 Grand would
be worth just under 415 Grand that's
almost 90 grand more so in that sense
buying the house is a pretty good
investment but if you're paying for the
down payment and other costs you're
letting go of the opportunity to invest
that money into other things so the
other option you could potentially have
is to invest that money in something
like the S P 500 at the yearly seven
percent average growth and then hoping
that the gain on your original
investment would be more than how much a
house would have appreciated during that
period if you were to buy the Home
Instead and there are so many
unpredictables and assumptions that come
into play here so how long will you stay
in the home when will you sell it what
will the market be like at the time
which part of the country are you buying
in et cetera Etc and so no one for sure
knows what will be the situation in 12
months or in 18 months time but we can
use this by versus rent calculator to
see whether we will fare better or
financially if we were to buy versus
whether we were to rent depending on
your scenario so if I use the same price
parameters that I've used in my example
earlier so buying a house for 325 Grand
down payment or 15 just rate of six
percent one of property costs of five
percent and then the annual maintenance
cost of one percent versus if I were to
rent and use the down payment and other
costs to invest Instead at a seven
percent interest assuming house prices
will increase at one to two percent then
looking down the line in five years time
old fare better off renting rather than
buying but the moment I changed these
assumptions and say house prices are
actually going to appreciate closer to
the three to four percent annually over
the period Then buying is a far better
option instead so the key thing to take
away here is that really depends on your
situation and when you think will be the
right time to buy or sell and then run
the numbers and the assumptions based on
your scenario and speaking to a mortgage
advisor we're still waiting for the dust
to settle in the UK and to understand
which way the interest rates are going
to go and also which way the property
prices are going to go there's a whole
range that can come into play when
factoring house prices says and a little
bit of that at the moment is down to the
worry that there are a lot of people
coming up to remortgage that are
experiencing payment shocks I.E if
they're on a fixed rate of something
like 1 1.5 1.6 then they are going to be
remortgaging onto something closer to
six percent some people will struggle
with that and we may see a lot more
people downsizing or renting properties
in the interim which then can mean a lot
more properties common to the market and
that could move the prices so it really
comes down to the relationship in demand
versus supply of the housing market and
one of the biggest questions is will
that slight change in prices or slow
down in both offset what you'd have to
pay in mortgage costs because of the
rising interest rates so these are the
calculations that you can do using that
link and speaking to your mortgage
advisor I usually look at property
purchases as a long-term investment and
generally speaking if you kind of like
zoom out and look at how house prices
have beared over the long term period
there's generally been an upward
trajectory with some minor dips and
setbacks along the way we also want to
consider the psychological factors if
you buy your house you have the
certainty T of not being asked to leave
by your landlord and knowing how much
you'll be paying for your mortgage for
the next two years or five years fixed
you have the freedom to do whatever you
want without needing permission from
your landlords you can put a screw
through the walls you can make an
extension you can go through the Loft
and add some more floor space and this
generally all increases the value of
your home which you can't do if you are
renting that period whereas the benefit
if you're renting is that you don't
actually have to worry for the cost of
repairs and maintenance or if something
breaks as this is technically the job of
the landlord but you do have to put down
a security deposit when you're moving in
which the landlord can then make
deductions from if you've damaged a load
of Staff or your drunk friends built red
wine all over the carpet or anything
like that on the plus side we're renting
is that you have the flexibility if you
want to move to a bigger space you want
to live somewhere else you want to
explore living in a specific area for a
short period the renting generally makes
it easier to do that but equally that
comes with higher relocation costs so if
you're thinking about buying versus
renting hopefully this gives you some
things to include and some things to
consider when looking at the two
scenarios I've left all the links to the
sites below if you like this video you
may also enjoy another video that I have
on dealing with a recession and how to
make sure you're prepared but also how
to make sure you'll thrive on the other
side I'll link that here for you and
hopefully see you there"
kVV2zbvcTc4,"I went from earning 35 Grand to hitting six digits 
in the space of three years and I truly believe  
that it was these key six traits that made me 
hit the six digit marks by the age of 24 and  
you don't know where to start start with this 
one it sounds like such an obvious one but it is  
so so overlooked and it's single-handedly the most 
important one out of the list and that is to close  
the learning Gap that the schooling system has 
created education at school is tailored towards  
getting a good job getting promoted earning a 
high salary and then we're told to save part  
of our pay the pay that the tax man doesn't rate 
for us they tell us to put that money into savings  
accounts with interest rates that don't even keep 
up with inflation and they tell us to invest it  
in Isis and 401ks which are managed by someone 
else who is making money doing it that's where  
the problem is building true wealth under this 
Paradigm is mathematically impossible in fact the  
schooling system is designed to keep most people 
poor or at least working hard their entire lives  
just to keep their head above water and we've 
been so indoctrinated in this ideology that  
most people just think this is the way it is and 
that there is no alternative there is nothing else  
to do they don't teach us financial literacy in 
school they don't teach us about mortgages about  
taxes about corporate structures managing your 
finances none of that so it's up to us to close  
the financial literacy Gap and educate ourselves 
on these topics read the books watch the Youtube  
videos listen to the podcast because a lot of 
Building Wealth and building income streams is  
about keeping the money you make and making good 
grow for you number two the spotlight effect this  
is one that used to really hold me back but when I 
got over it it was a very kind of a Monumental and  
liberating feeling for me I always worried about 
what other people thought about me doing something  
what my family would think what my friends would 
think what my colleagues would think but as you  
get older and I guess you learn with time that no 
one actually cares about what you're doing there's  
this phenomenon in Psychology called the spotlight 
effect and the basic idea is that we go about our  
lives thinking that there is a spotlight Trail on 
our centered only us and everyone is looking at  
what we're doing and they're judging it but in 
reality we are only the center and focal point  
of Our Own Story we are just a small snippet 
in everyone else's and there's a famous quote  
that says we would worry less about what other 
people think about us if we actually realized  
how rarely they do so stop worrying about what 
other people think and if you fail or succeed  
publicly and when you do you'll be willing to 
take on more opportunities that you would have  
otherwise been too afraid to take before number 
three question the answer so once I learned that  
I need to do this so many more doors opened up 
for me just because one person said they can't  
help you or that your business idea isn't viable 
it doesn't mean it's a no and that you should pack  
it all in there are a 101 ways to get to the same 
destination so it may just mean that you need to  
knock on another door or take another path that no 
one has trodden down before when I was 23 I made  
up in my mind that I was going to hit six digits 
before my 25th birthday and that I wasn't going to  
let anything stop me from getting there I worked 
super hard that year and at the end of the year I  
made a case to my boss at the time and said okay 
this is why I deserve that pay rise and he took  
it away and basically came back and said it's not 
possible and gave me this reason and this reason  
and this reason and I could have either just sat 
there and said okay this is the reality I'm going  
to accept it there's nothing I could do about it 
or take the matter in my own hands and say okay  
this isn't the answer that I was expecting but 
that doesn't mean there isn't another way that  
will get me there that's when I started Living 
below my means and saved up enough to buy my  
first investment property which then led to me 
hitting that goal so if you want to get from A  
to B it's not just one row that will get you there 
it's not just one person that will help you or one  
company that would help you achieve it you may 
have to take a couple of detours and a load of  
rejections and setbacks but honestly and you'll 
hear me say this time and time again when there  
is a will there is a way so if you want to take 
away one thing from this video let it be that  
number four money out equals money in this is one 
of the most important ones and I wish someone had  
drawn this into me earlier I know so many people 
who work in well-paid jobs they earn a lot and  
they say they want to start all these side hustles 
and start building passive income streams but they  
don't want to spend any money to get started and I 
think this is really quite a self-limiting thought  
because they're spending on all these depreciating 
assets they're going out on all these fancy  
holidays and extravagant restaurants but once 
it comes to actually investing that money they  
don't want to do that they don't want to invest 
that money in themselves or on courses or on the  
better equipment for their podcast they won't 
be booing to part with that money that gets to  
a point with almost any Venture where to be able 
to scale it or take it to the next stage you're  
going to have to spend some money and sometimes 
that means spending money to free up to time so  
that you can even start that Venture in the first 
place as Naval says in his book The Almanac set an  
hourly rate for yourself be it 20 dollars an hour 
50 an hour and anything you can Outsource at less  
than that hourly rate then do it you'll find that 
doing this will free up so much time for you that  
you could spend working on your Ventures or your 
own business ideas or educating yourself before  
I used to think okay I'll do everything myself 
I'll just spend 10 days on trying to learn this  
by myself instead of paying someone else to do 
it but that mindset of saving money at the cost  
of your time can't follow you through to financial 
wealth and abundance number five a fomo will hold  
you back fomo is fear of missing out a fear of 
missing out when you see your friends living  
their best life on Instagram eating out all the 
time buying the latest iPhone a new car going on  
a big holiday and it takes a lot of willpower to 
say no to these things when everyone around you  
is doing it but if you let your fomo get the 
best of you then you're sacrificing your own  
narrative you'll be throwing away unnecessary 
amounts of money trying to keep up with their  
lifestyle you're seeing other people live you'll 
be wasting unnecessary amounts of valuable time  
that you can spend on working yourself or 
working on your side hustle just because  
of Bobo and everyone is going to get a level 
of fear of missing out at some point but I've  
learned that the only remedy for fomo is finding 
meaning in what you're doing it doesn't mean it  
has to be the most fulfilling thing in the world 
or the most satisfying thing that brings you the  
most happiness meaning just means that it's part 
of a bigger narrative that you're building in your  
life now I'm very clear with the direction I'm 
going and where I want to be in my life in five  
years time and in 10 years time and whenever I 
see something that someone else posts on social  
media that makes me feel like I'm not living my 
best life and going out all the time and living  
completely in the here and now then I just remind 
myself that it's all in the idea or because of  
this meaning and at the end these small little 
sacrifices that I make now will all be worth it  
in the end number six action before over analysis 
this is one that's probably had the biggest impact  
have thought about doing it for a good six months 
while I was thinking about what my knee should be  
about that new project and think about investing 
for the future but what's really going to make  
at some point you become acutely aware that 
the result of not taking action will be far  
more painful than whatever may happen if you take 
action even if you don't have it all planned out  
by virtue of just getting started you're naturally 
going to be taking on feedback along the way just  
get going you can always change the path if you 
need to based on the feedback you're getting  
you'll learn and improve just by doing Jeff oslin 
in the book The Slight Edge says that the more you  
overthink preparing to start your goal the more 
overwhelmed you will feel and the less likely you  
are to take the action so keeping your thoughts 
about your plan simple helps you get out of your  
own head and into action more quickly just take 
the opportunity and you'll learn the most just by  
doing it so that guys is what's kept me motivated 
and kept me going if you enjoyed this video I've  
linked a few others here which you may also enjoy 
thanks for watching and hopefully see you there"
-riUXV1K-rw,"hi everyone welcome back to the channel in this 
video I'm going to go over five different ways  
you can make money online and for each of these 
I'm going to cover how hard it is to get started  
and how hard it is to maintain alongside your day 
job all of these five streams of income are ones  
that I've either done myself I've paid someone 
to do it or I've included examples of people  
that have done it and are making thousands a 
month from it I'm not including any which I  
wouldn't be willing to do myself so this is the 
video that I wish I watched when I first started  
my journey to achieving Financial Freedom let's 
get into it number one is newsletters this is  
an old idea but over the last couple of years 
it has massively come back in the scene and I  
almost feel like it's the new Vlog there are a 
few main reasons for a lot of people doing this  
now firstly there are Services making it super 
easy to start a newsletter like substack for  
example where you could start your own newsletter 
at zero cost that's the platform that I use for my  
bi-weekly newsletter and it's completely free 
second reason it's blown up is because people  
are realizing that social media is renting land 
with one change in algorithm you could lose all  
visibility team with your audience everything you 
own belongs to the social media platform whether  
it's tick tock whether it's YouTube whether it's 
Instagram and so newsletters are a really good way  
of taking your audience off of these platforms and 
instead of being the renter being the landlord and  
the third reason is because you can make a lot 
of money without even having to put your face  
on anything one of the most popular newsletters 
today is called morning brew and it brings you the  
Daily News in a really digestible and entertaining 
manner morning brew has over 4 million subscribers  
and last year in 2021 the newsletter company 
generated over 50 million dollars in Revenue  
the majority of that Revenue came from sponsored 
ads and affiliate links and the way morning Brew  
grew so big was purely through Word of Mouth 
endorsement and their referral scheme in terms  
of getting started I would give this a one out 
of five it is super easy to get started type of  
sentences or two and just send it out I think to 
grow it it's a bit more difficult if you don't  
already have an audience because if that is the 
case then you'll be relying heavily on Word of  
Mouth so in terms of Maintenance I would give 
this a three out of five because you would be  
spending a lot time to promote number two is 
selling a digital product these are products  
that you create online you create it once like an 
ebook a download an app or something like that and  
then you create once and then you can sell it 
multiple times and there is a guy called easel  
uh you can check them out on Twitter and this guy 
essentially just shares how to be more productive  
and get more out of notion which if you haven't 
heard of it it's an online note-taking platform  
he shares tips and tricks and creates his own 
templates and in the first nine months of this  
year alone he made over two hundred thousand 
dollars just through selling templates and  
I've seen a lot of other content creators also 
catch on to this recently with starting their  
own templates and information workflow setups and 
it just goes to show that just because one person  
has done it it doesn't stop anyone else from 
doing it and creating it with their own spin  
or their own style and as with anything online 
there is no cap in the audience and there is no  
limit so how hard is this to get started I will 
give this one out of five in terms of difficulty  
unlike physical products where you have to buy 
the equipment buy the fabric by the material  
there is no upfront cost with starting a 
digital template what you do need however  
is to sell something that can add some sort of 
value to other people and that there is demand  
for so if you can identify a problem or a gap in 
the market and use your existing skills or learn  
new skills to close that Gap in terms of ongoing 
maintenance I would give this a one out of five  
once you've got it started up and running there 
is very little you need to do to maintain it from  
there number three is video editing on one side 
a lot of content creators advice on Outsourcing  
editing and that you can do this really cheap 
and I don't know if it's just me but getting  
a good reliable editor is expensive and there is 
a big shortage of high quality ones for a lot of  
content creators the editing part is the first 
thing that they Outsource and when you approach  
experienced editors on freelance service websites 
like Fiverr or like upwork they're charging more  
than 100 to edit a 10 minute video so if you want 
to make some solid cash this is definitely a good  
way to go if you're starting out I'd recommend 
to price competitively as your selling point to  
attract new customers and then once you've got 
in the reviews you've got the recommendations  
you can then scale it bigger to thousands of 
dollars in terms of how hard this is I would give  
it a two it's pretty easy to learn how to edit if 
I can edit literally anyone could edit but before  
I started this YouTube channel I didn't know 
a thing about Final Cut Pro or adobe but there  
is an abundance of free information online and I 
personally learned how to edit through skillshare  
and it taught me everything that I need to know to 
get started you can get 30 days free on skillshare  
using my link below and to be honest you can just 
sign up use the free trial watch the course and  
cancel it if you don't want to keep it I probably 
should be saying that but in terms of Maintenance  
I would give this a thought although it can 
be very very lucrative it is something that  
requires trading your time for money and a lot 
of your time for money so if you are doing this  
alongside your nine-to-five job then this is 
something you'd want to consider number four  
is a SAS business SAS stands for software as a 
service and it's a way of delivering applications  
over the internet as a service there are so many 
people making money online through this and you  
won't even realize that or you won't even know 
it because most of these people don't have an  
audience and that's one of the best things about 
it an example of this is a website called Nomad  
list it lets people find the best places to go to 
and to work on based on what their preferences are  
whether it's like good weather cost of living a 
safety internet speed and the owner who created  
SP to levels who also created a complimentary 
website called remoteok.com which is essentially  
just a job board which posts remote jobs that are 
available and these two SAS businesses alone make  
him 2.7 million dollars a year and he has zero 
employees he even posted online he said I have  
no funding I have no debt I have no employees 
just revenue and profit margins are somewhere  
between 80 and 90 so in terms of getting started 
I'll probably give this a forward it's more of an  
idea that you have to come up with so it might 
take a bit of throwing specially at the wall  
and seeing what sticks but in terms of Maintenance 
I'll give this a lot once it's up and running the  
services can be very self-sufficient and most of 
the work the coding the designing is all done up  
front five create an online course this is kind of 
like a digital product but it's in a video format  
so in terms of getting started I would give this 
a two out of five it's not hard to make an online  
course but you do need to have basic skills 
and like communication speaking to camera and  
generally having a skill or a knowledge that you 
can teach others about and the only reason people  
will really pay for it is if it's actually good 
and there's value that they're getting out of it  
but the world of online education has exploded 
there is so much money being pumped into the  
space so if you have a valuable skill that you 
could teach this is probably one of the most  
rewarding ways to make money online it's a way 
that you can use your strengths to teach and add  
value to others you can also make money without 
having to charge people directly for your course  
using a platform again like skillshare this isn't 
sponsored I actually use their premium membership  
I think it's a really great place to learn stuff 
I have thousands of courses on thousands of  
different topics and anyone can teach things on 
skillshare without having an audience anyone can  
upload a class to the site and the way it works 
is you get paid based on the amount of time that  
someone watches your video so if you already have 
an audience then that's even better you have an  
audience that know you they like you they trust 
you and they'll go to skillshare specifically  
to watch your class but even if you don't have an 
audience if your class is really good and you're  
getting good reviews for it people are watching 
it then skillshare has its own algorithm so if you  
make a really good class that people watch a lot 
and it has good ratings good reviews then it will  
just rise to the Top by itself and it will come up 
in the skillshare homepage or it will be the first  
some people search for it on their website they 
say that the top teachers are earning more than  
a hundred grand per year on the platform in terms 
of Maintenance when you've made the course that's  
it you're done you just let it run so in terms of 
Maintenance I would give this a one out of five  
I see a lot of people try something new and they 
give up before giving it a real chance and that's  
because it's human nature to expect instant 
gratification and reward for doing something  
I mean that's the way we've been conditioned 
through school to expect immediate results but  
studies show that this act of expecting immediate 
success can actually stop you from achieving your  
goals because you just keep abandoning projects 
halfway through you don't actually see the project  
through a lot of the streams that I've mentioned 
are passive income streams and passive income  
isn't about overnight success it's about 
putting in the hard work now to reap the  
benefits later on so that that's it from me guys 
I hope you enjoyed this one if you liked it I've  
got another video here which you might enjoy 
on millionaire habits hopefully see you there"
qYc87IonRAo,"do to become a millionaire by 32.
Everything I will be sharing is coming through
1) my own personal experience on what has
worked and what HASN’T 2) tips that i’ve
gained from reading books of the biggest money
and business experts in the world and 3) psychological
based evidence around the human brain.
Later in this video I’ll also talk about
how one of these made me $40,000 better off
within one hour.
So the first thing I am going to do if focus
on my all-weather portfolio.
This is based on the fact that most people
earn wages, but you’ll never get wealthy
working for wages because wages grow linearly
- that is the amount you earn is directly
related to the amount of time you work.
On top of that, just relying on wages is risky
because the moment you decide to quit or get
fired that income stream stops coming in.
What I’ve realised over the past few years
is to also focus on building up passive streams,
which have the potential to grow non linearly
because they dont require you trading your
time for money.
As soon as you make one on auto pilot and
let it run, it gives you time to focus others
and grow your income more and more because
the ones on auto pilot are continuing to bring
in money for you without you needing to devote
any time to it.
The second thing I will be doing is thinking
in terms of first principles.
I first came across this concept in an interview
with Elon musk.
The idea of it is that just because things
have always been done a certain way that doesn’t
mean it’s the best way and that we shouldn’t
be afraid to question the status quo.
When someone tells me something isn’t possible
I have this knee jerk reaction to prove to
them why it is possible.
I used to host social events- and as part
of the marketing for one of the events i organised
- I told my business partner at the time that
we need to make a really cool physical invite,
one that people want to upload and put on
social media and we can get free marketing,
and i remember him saying at the time oh we
cant do that because of this and we’ve always
done it like this so it doesn’t make sense
to change it now it will take too much time.
I feel like that’s this subtle messaging
is something that I’ve faced so many times
in different facets of my life and its just
way of saying stick to the blue print, stick
to convention and it’s these moments where
you’ve got to have some sort of restistance
and say no I’m going to explore another
way.
One person thought he can build rockets and
send them to mars- that person was Elon musk.
Someone else thought they can bend a piece
of aluminium and get it to fly through the
air - that was the wright brothers.
In any concept, you can’t get extraordinary
results from ordinary actions.
The world doesn’t offer outsized returns
for people and brands that serve up “more
of the same”.
The third thing I am going to be doing to
get to that million dollar mark is utilising
other people strengths - and this is the one
that saved me £30,000 within an hour.
There is a saying that is “if you are the
smartest person in the room, you’re in the
wrong room”.
I used to always think I could figure everything
out myself and that I can save money just
by doing things on my own but now I’ve realised
that different people have completely different
unique strengths and skills and that is essentially
how they make a living.
I purchased a property under a company structure
and I needed to move it to another company
and I realised to do that I would need to
pay $30k in different forms of taxes.
So I tried to google why I needed to pay this
and whether there were any examples that proved
i don’t need to pay it and there was a way
around this.
I then spoke to my friend told me why don’t
you just speak to a tax advisor that’s what
they’re their for - I forked out what killed
me at the time, $200 for a 1 hour chat with
a tax adviser who is a specialist in this
field and gave me a completely legal tax efficient
strategy which saved me from paying that $40,000
- and had I not done that I would’ve ended
up paying that money away not knowing any
better.
In a world where hard work is no longer a
competitive advantage - because everyone works
hard, the competitive advantage is actually
in thinking expansively and connecting with
the right people.**Th**e forth thing I am
going to keep in my mind until I get to my
goal is the concept of the slight Edge.
This is based on a book written by motivation
speaker Jeff Oslon.
According to Jeff success and failure are
both a result of the slight edge - the idea
that simple little things that we choose to
do or choose not to do on a daily basis have
a compounding effect on who we ultimately
become.
So I like to use the penny compounding parable
here - there are two people who are given
the choice to either get one million dollars
at the beginning of the next month - thats
it a flat cheque for 1 million dollars, or
choose to receive one penny at the beginning
of next month but that penny doubles every
single day for the next 30 days.
The person who chooses to go with the flat
one million dollars got that one million dollars,
but the second kid who chose to go with the
penny that doubled every single day ended
up with over $5.3mn.
And if you take this and stretch it into a
longer timeframe, thats essentially how compounding
in our life works.
These small little things you choose to do,
or don’t do, every day matter because they
have long-term ramifications that will eventually
show up.
I now try to remind myself whats uncomfortable
now will become comfortable later.
Lean into your money making superpower.
I saw a YouTuber oliur talk about this one
and I really loved the way he described it.
He talks about how everyone has this money
**making super power to lean into.** Most
people don’t tap into it, they don’t understand
it or they haven’t yet figured it out but
everyone does have it.
The way I kind of see this and have interpreted
it is that you need to lean into our most
valuable strengths, these strengths can come
from 1) our upbringing, your parents and what
you’ve been surrounded with and knowledge
we’ve absorbed growing up 2) it can come
through the skills you’ve learnt just through
doing or that you’re teaching yourself or
3) through your passions or interest but through
one of these avenues will unlock your money
making superpower that you can lean into it.
The way I see it is im still trying different
things, explore, discover new things - starting
a YouTube channel being one of them - and
by doing this I am going to lean into my strengths
and will eventually hone into my money making
superpower.
Living below your means.
It’s really easy to spend everything you
earn and living paycheck to paycheck.
As you earn more you want a bigger house a
nicer car, and your lifestyle choices inflate
as your monthly pay check gets bigger.
When I first started working I’d spent everything
I earned and every single bonus would go towards
material items and things that I couldn’t
care less about 2 months later, and then I
realised if I keep doing this I’m going
to get to 35, having worked for 15+ years
and have nothing substantial to even show
for it, so I massively changed my spending
habits and I talk about how much i spend now
in this video here.
do agree that your teenage years and early
20s are when you want to be really living
your life to the max so i wouldn’t really
worry about saving the $5, $10 at this age
- but then later there comes a time where
you want to be making some sacrifices in the
short term and holding off on buying some
things now, with the aim to reinstate those
things back into your life later when the
trade off isnt as big.
So for example, I’ve wanted to buy a new
car for a while but I ran the numbers and
actually I barely drive - i work full time
and i travel to work on the train and when
i go out on the weekend i just grab an uber,
and the decision to sell my last car and wait
a bit till i buy my new one has saved me a
ridiculous amount of money - i save money
on insurance, maintenance, finance or a lease,
not to mention also the money that i would’ve
lost in the depreciation.
So for me -given having a car isn’t a necessity
for me right now, I’m using that money now
to invest in assets instead to build a lifestyle
that i want, and then eventually have these
assets and the cash flow coming in from those
assets pay for all the nice luxury things
later on.
If you liked this video I’ve made another
one on my journey so far and what I am going
to be doing going forward.
I’ll link that here, thanks for watching
- don’t forget to subscribe if you haven’t
already.
See you in the next video."
fk06PZ5I7U4,"hi everyone welcome back in this video I'm going 
to be breaking down all of the money that I spent  
expenses and then also on how much I spend on 
luxury items and random splurges I'll be honest  
this is a bit of an outrageous video to make I 
don't know if anyone cares about how much I spend  
on a given month but given I've binge watched a 
lot of videos of other people talking about how  
much they spend I thought maybe people will also 
find this interesting timestamps are below so you  
can skip to whatever part most interests you but 
for now let's get started okay firstly I wanted  
to cover how I make money I make money through 
my day job I work in banking and I do that full  
a personal finance channel so I've split this up 
into categories being my needs my wants and then  
my savings slash Investments so let's start with 
my needs these are my fixed expenses my living  
expenses my biggest expense is my mortgage I pay 
just under 1 200 pounds towards my mortgage which  
is actually pretty reasonable considering where I 
live I live in a two-bedroom apartment in London  
and the reason why this is pretty reasonable is 
because I locked in the mortgage rate when it was  
pretty low during the pandemic so I'm paying 1.6 
and the repayment scheme is half capital and half  
interest which brings down my monthly payments 
even more so for me having somewhere to stay that  
makes me feel happy is really important I spend 
so much of my time at home I spend my weekends at  
home my evenings working from home and so I feel 
like it has a massive impact on my mental energy  
my mental space I then pay ground rent and service 
charge which totals to 2 200 pounds a year or 180  
pounds a month and these are costs that I have 
to pay given I live in a building and have to pay  
towards the ongoing maintenance my utility bills 
include electricity energy and water bill that  
comes up to 210 pounds and internet connection 
is 20 pounds bringing that to 230 quid council  
tax I pay 1 800 pounds a year which is 150 pounds 
a month groceries I spend on average 120 pounds a  
month on food shop which isn't too bad I do a big 
shop every week from my local supermarket and I  
try and keep my fridge stacked up so that I'm not 
tempted to just come home after a long day at work  
and Splurge out on a delivery or a takeaway or 
anything like that travel this is a necessity it  
makes me go travel to and from work I only get 
the train which is about 100 pounds a month so  
that totals up to 1 980 pounds just for my basic 
living expenses let's move on to my wants shall  
we so subscriptions Amazon subscription Spotify 
subscription my Apple Fitness subscription and my  
Nespresso coffee pod subscription that totals up 
to 60 pounds a month let's look at Ubers on Ubers  
I spent 150 pounds a month this is something I do 
spread out on a little I do try and walk and get  
public transport as much as I can but when it's 
a matter of safety so for example taking public  
transport or walking alone late at night then I 
would just get in an Uber and sometimes I also  
get an Uber when I prioritize convenience as well 
like if it's going to take me over an hour to get  
somewhere by public transport but it's just a 
30 minute drive and I've got some work to do  
then I'll just jump in at Uber my next expense 
is on eating out eating out in London is not  
cheap and now every time I go for dinner I spend 
on average 50 pounds and I go out around once a  
week on average I don't mind spending this much I 
usually like trying out new places and having time  
to catch up with friends and family this number 
also includes the times where I grab lunch at  
work which is around eight to nine pounds a day 
for a meal in the city for a quick lunch meal  
in the city if it is a client lunch or a client 
dinner then I can just expense this through the  
company and that won't be coming out of my bank 
account the next thing I spend on is activities  
this category includes all of my social plans that 
don't involve eating so I try to force myself to  
do something new every month something that I've 
never tried before and this month it was kayaking  
on the River Thames which costs 100 pounds for 
two people and I guess this kind of comes with  
getting older I would rather spend 100 pounds on 
doing something new and creating a memory rather  
than buying something material which is why my 
shopping at the moment I've put this in as zero  
pounds because I was looking through my budget 
tracker and I haven't spent any money on a new  
item of clothing for the last six months I don't 
really enjoy buying clothes this was something I  
loved doing when I was a bit younger but now 
if I do shop it's for something specific but  
that isn't really a regular occurrence for 
me anymore the final category is gifts the  
reason why I have included this in my average 
reoccurring monthly expenses is because for  
last six months I have spent on average 150 
pounds a month on guests so these include  
birthday presents wedding presents housewarming 
presents presents for kids so this is an expense  
that doesn't seem to be disappearing anytime 
soon so my once spending totals out to 760  
pounds a month on average which brings my 
Grand Coastal of monthly expenses to 2 800  
pounds this doesn't include ad hocs expenses so 
like expenses that I've paid for a haircut a new  
piece of furniture for my apartment or holidays 
holidays is definitely my second biggest expense  
after my mortgage and I've got a video on 
how much I spent in Bali last month but this  
tends to give you a rough idea of my ongoing 
expenditure London is known to be one of the  
most expensive cities in the world so given I'm 
spending below my means without limiting myself  
and without reason and still saving a large 
portion every month I'm happy with where this  
is and I'm pretty glad that I don't Splurge out 
on things that I used to when I was a bit Young  
when it comes to saving I try not to focus on 
the smaller things that have a disproportionate  
impact on how much it costs versus the happiness 
it adds to my day like a nice cup of coffee but  
rather focusing on the big ticket items like 
cutting down my mortgage and making sure I'm  
locked into a good rate for example that those 
big things are the things that really make the  
difference at the end of the day there is a limit 
to how much you can save and you won't be Building  
Wealth through finding discount codes or cutting 
out vouchers but you can through focusing on the  
earnings and growth potential which is why my 
main priority and focus is and has been on that  
with the savings that I have I use it to invest be 
it in real estate in the stock market in my side  
hustles I've got loads of videos on my Channel 
about the different income streams and different  
side hustles I have as well I'm really Keen to 
know if any of this surprises you about living in  
London or regarding what I do for a living that 
you thought would dictate my spending and how  
different that was to the reality if you enjoyed 
this video I've got another one on my Channel  
about how how much I spent working remotely from 
Bali I'll leave a link to that here thank you so  
much for watching don't forget to subscribe if 
you haven't already see you in my next video"
kzg1ZOd3NbI,"hey guys welcome back to the channel in this 
video I'm going to go over 10 life lessons  
that I've learned from working in Investment 
Banking let's get into it number one document  
it what I mean by this is if you get some great 
advice from a colleague you read something that  
Sparks your interest or even just recognize 
a habit of someone else's that inspires you  
please please take a physical note of it you 
won't think anything of it at the time but if  
you just take 10 minutes to compile your thoughts 
and what you've learned from it and what you'll do  
as a result of this thing that will really help 
you when you look back in the future every time  
I see something noteworthy I add it straight 
away to my Apple notes on the go and over the  
years I've created this kind of gold mine of 
a document full of all these amazing tips and  
advice and every time I read it I feel like 
super energized and super inspired now that  
I'm starting my newsletter and I've been over the 
last weeks thinking about what I'm going to write  
about I've been digging into this document so 
much and thinking about what has benefited me  
the most and why I can continue sharing through my 
own experiences so don't understand estimate the  
benefits of documenting these key learnings number 
two align your career with who you are whoever you  
are whichever organization you're working for 
you want to make sure you are getting as much  
value from your company as they are getting from 
you and I mean more than just a monthly paycheck  
if you're feeling lost in your career use your 
job as an opportunity to explore and do more
of purpose and for meaning in their work is 
not to Discount the opportunity that exists  
in organizations themselves however big or small 
there are so many opportunities for growth for  
learning for development and meeting people from 
all walks of life so use this to your advantage  
you want to create learning opportunities within 
the context of what you're already doing because  
chances are you have worked so damn hard to 
get to wherever you are anyway and that's not  
something you want to throw away really quickly 
no one loves every part of the job no one but  
you can shape your job if you enjoy organizing 
events and you want to be an event coordinator  
but you work in finance stop putting your hand 
up for organizing the socials and taking the lead  
with the with those if you're more of a spiritual 
person and enjoy meditating set up free workshops  
that people can join outside of work finding a 
way to get more involved in areas that you're  
interested in will start opening up creative 
channels and you may even figure out that you  
like doing something as a hobby but you never want 
to do it full time and that's okay Clarity comes  
from doing number three don't hunt for a mentor 
or change the narrative from get a mentor and  
you'll Excel to Excel and you'll get a mentor 
I feel like people often have this imprisoning  
idea that they need to find this one person that 
will guide them through their Journey you don't  
need that and I still don't have one Mentor who 
I go for for everything your inspiration can come  
from podcasts from music from something you see 
on YouTube or Twitter people think that finding  
a mentor is the key to unlock your future it isn't 
we have the internet now hundreds of people can be  
your Mentor through the click of a mouse you could 
have in the palm of your hand through a smartphone  
there are so many mentors out there just within 
a click yes stick to the facts as much as you can  
try and stick to the facts because facts can't 
be disputed and they hold more credibility than  
emotions or than opinions this can apply to so 
many things like articulating an idea persuading  
someone to buy into your proposal or even just 
having a discussion in the workplace or out of the  
workplace and in your personal life and expressing 
how you feel about something sticking to facts  
it gives you a stronger starting point so for 
example if you feel like your ideas are being  
neglected then instead of saying oh you never 
take my suggestions seriously try saying I feel  
frustrated that you have not responded to my 
last four emails which leads me to believe that  
my suggestions are not that important to you 
the latter is a lot harder to deny rules are  
man-made when I look back at my career the times 
of my career has really propelled or when I've  
excelled the most is when I've thought outside 
the box and not followed the standard protocol  
Cheryl Sandberg who is the ex-co of Facebook 
talks about this in her book lean in she said  
she took questions from an audience after giving 
a talk to a room and then announced that she'll  
take two more questions after two more questions 
were answered all the women in the room put their  
hands down and all the men kept their hands up 
and she continued to answer questions the biggest  
takeaways from this is to keep your hand up just 
because someone has made a ball it doesn't mean  
you need to obey it without questioning it just 
because there have been things that are done a  
certain way that doesn't mean it's the right way 
or that it's the only way there are so many ways  
to get what you want you've just got to keep 
going put yourself forward even if you face  
getting rejected or a level of embarrassment just 
navigate a way to get what you want then we have  
full circle to be honest I wish more people in 
life knew and applied this one life has a funny  
way of going full circle and you never really 
know if a person that you crossed paths with  
today will come back into your life at a later 
stage so don't be mean to people you will only  
ever regret it be approachable be kind and look 
up from your phone in the work lift and actually  
engage in a conversation because that costs 
you nothing and you never know when someone  
you helped years ago remembers something you've 
done and comes through for you years later if  
you're heir to the ground now this is a bit of 
an odd one so let me explain a lot of getting  
ahead in life is about who you know and who 
you surround yourself with you want to know  
what's happening around you and be connected to 
others because that means when new opportunities  
come around you'll be the first one to add you can 
move quickly and you can take them up if you just  
have your head down buried in the sand and you 
just do your job and you do it well then there are  
a number of other people that can also do that you 
are nothing special you really want to dive into  
things that give you wider visibility and exposure 
and one of the best ways to do that is by keeping  
your ear to the ground and staying connected to 
people don't accept the first offer there are two  
sides to every negotiation it is in the company's 
interest to spend less and pay you less and it's  
in your interest to get paid more and get paid 
your worth so keep pushing if you are given a  
number don't ask is this number negotiable but 
dig into what went into calculating that figure  
where has the number come from has it counted for 
your many years of experience your qualifications  
there are many companies that don't want you to 
negotiate but that doesn't mean you don't come  
so normal to feel like there's a knowledge Gap and 
like you don't know enough or have enough value to  
add but you really want to be seen as someone who 
has something to contribute no matter how small  
that thing is even if you are completely new 
to the game don't underestimate the importance  
of casting a fresh pair of eyes on something and 
giving your unique perspective you want to be seen  
as someone who adds value and who does contribute 
if you really can't think of anything to say then  
try taking on kind of the opening of a call or a 
meeting or summarizing the discussion at the end  
and kind of consolidating the next steps be seen 
to have a niche this is one that I found in my  
document and a piece of advice that my first boss 
told me you want to be known as the go-to person  
for something even if it is doing the [ __ ] 
stuff or the stuff that no one else wants to do  
you want to carve out a niche for yourself and 
be recognized for something this applies to so  
many walks of life having a niche and defining 
your brand is what will differentiate you from  
everyone else it will create value for you and 
I've added another Point here because I'm extra  
take on the hard stuff if you get a job offer for 
something and you don't know how to do it take it  
and learn how to do it after you don't learn to 
walk by following the rules you learn by doing and  
by falling over and this goes for so many things 
in life starting a YouTube channel starting a new  
side hustles taking on a high profile project at 
work you will learn a tremendous tremendous amount  
just by doing more than you will through reading 
the textbooks and through the planning stage  
just by putting in the action and Diving straight 
into the deep end that experience in itself will  
offer you a three to five year Head Start versus 
someone who's sitting on the sidelines and spends  
more time analyzing and perfecting everything 
and only dipping their toes in the water and  
getting in only when they're ready so guys those 
are the things that have taken me years and years  
to learn and hopefully by sharing this I have 
fast tracked those things for you if you like  
this video I've linked another one here on other 
life lessons and money lessons and I really do  
hope you enjoy watching these videos and I want 
to say thank you for watching for engaging for  
commenting it really is that kind of stuff that 
makes me keep on going see you in the next video"
gHM_fQQGquc,"hi guys welcome back if you're new here I'm Nisha 
and in the past week I had been working remotely  
from what is Apparently one of the cheapest places 
in the world Bali I had a pretty good balance of  
working versus playing and spending on a budget 
versus spending slightly out of my means which  
made this week a little more interesting I do find 
it slightly absurd making a video on how much I  
spent in a week better seems to be quite a popular 
Trend so I thought I'll make my own anyway I do  
have some ground rules I want to cover for this 
video but first let's get started with day one  
Monday day one I landed at DPS airport and got 
a taxi straight to Ubud which cost me all of 14  
for a one and a half hour Journey this was 
pre-booked online via an agent but during  
that journey I became really good friends in my 
driver who I ended up using for every journey in  
Bali from there on I stayed in a hotel called 
Sanya Bungalows it was an old style building  
situated right in the heart of Ubud a five minute 
walk from all the main sites and neighboring one  
of the busiest marketplaces I wanted to stay 
right in the center just making it easy to  
get around and avoid the barley traffic and 
not worry about how I'm going to get anywhere  
but Bali traffic it's honestly a nightmare I 
was stuck in it a few times stay here for my  
first two nights on the first night I went for a 
standard room which had no air conditioning so I  
basically melted during the night and there 
was no running hot water and it cost me 27  
for the night which included backburst I got 
a massage at taksu which is a very lush jungle  
Paradise Spa and it's pretty expensive for Uber 
in Ubud most massages are 12 to 15 but I am a  
for Lonely Planet recommendations and so I had 
to try this out the massage was incredible and  
each room had a shower with hot running water so 
I definitely made my money's worth and compensated  
for the lack of facilities at my accommodation 
I skipped lunch and I went straight for dinner
okay so a couple of ground rules for this video 
because I am an accountant so best believe I  
am taking this seriously probably too seriously 
ground rule number one I'm using U.S dollar for  
this video because it's a more recognized currency 
than the Indonesian rupee and I'm converting  
everything at today's exchange rate which is 
one dollar to 15 640 Indonesian rupees ground  
rule number two I'm not including any of the tips 
that I gave out on the trip I'm only calculating  
the actual price of the good or service number 
three my partner did join me for the last few  
days of the trip but I've only included the stuff 
that I consumed so if you went out for dinner and  
we got a meal I have only included their food 
that I consumed and the cost of that I've also  
included the full accommodation cost although 
in reality this could be split day two Tuesday  
right so on the second night I decided to stay 
in Sanya Bungalows once again but I decided to  
Splash out and get an upgrade which cost me 
all of two dollars more and that two dollars  
was probably the best two dollars I spent on 
the whole trap for that extra two dollars I  
got tired flooring I got a working toilet I got 
hot running water and I got an air conditioning  
unit and there was also an outdoor balcony space 
where I worked from in the mornings and all kind  
of animals strolling by which is why I loved this 
place for lunch as I was spending a lot of time  
working remotely from coffees or restaurants 
whilst I was in a bit I didn't mind spending  
a bit more for a nice coffee or a lunch place 
in exchange for working in a nice environment  
the way I see it is when I look at these places 
I would spend a good few hours there so I kind  
of saw it like paying rent to be at that coffee 
shop that said apart from one place in Bali which  
I'll come to in a second nothing would top the 
extortionate prices that I paid for a coffee in  
London so yes it really didn't hurt my soul to 
spend a few dollars more for a coffee or lunch
foreign [Music]
studios in the evening I paid 14 for a class 
where I basically just laid down and listened  
to some music and got my face splashed 
with water by the instructor a few times  
sorry yoga bun I know a lot of tourists 
love you but you're just not for me moving  
on to Wednesday on Wednesday I made my 
way down to seminyak obviously using my  
favorite driver this journey cost me 12 
for a one and a half hour drive system s
cafes so I spent a bit more on my accommodation 
this time I got this fill out with a private  
pool this private open space and this very exotic 
bathroom this cost me 230 dollars for one night  
and floating breakfast was included for another 
six dollars on top I hired out a moped whilst I  
was in seminyak which cost me five dollars for 
the day and I thought petrol which was 30 cents  
for half a liter so I think seminyak is probably 
the most touristy place out of all of Bali and  
all the local businesses and local restaurants 
were run by Australians and that was definitely  
reflected in the price of everything there was a 
big difference in the pricing between the local  
restaurants owned by the local Balinese people 
and the restaurants owned by New Zealand or  
Australians I loved the coffee at revolver which 
is run by an Australian guy which is why it was  
four dollars for a latte which is equivalent 
to an average daily salary of a Balinese staff  
worker so I had dinner at Potato Head and 
ended the evening at a moto Mexico [Music]
on Thursday I stayed in the same Villa for one 
more night but spent the day exploring changu  
which is basically a 40 minute drive from Seven 
yeah I spent the day at the La Brisa Beach Club  
had some pizza and drinks for this month and 
in the evening I grabbed dinner which included  
noodles and a coke for three dollars I also did 
my laundry out there which was two dollars for  
a kilo Friday we went to jambrown beach on the 
way we stopped over at tanyong Benoit Beach Club  
I think I pronounced that right and we did some 
jet skiing there which was 35 for 15 minutes after  
some negotiations and of course I support myself 
to another Balinese massage for 12 knowing that  
back in the UK I will be paying for one massage 
or it would cost me for four massages in Bali  
so yes I will happily welcome all the massages 
that I can get had lunch which was 13 for these  
two dishes so six dollars just for my own portion 
accommodation wise I found this amazing Villa it  
was as a last minute Escape deal on booking.com 
and I booked it in the morning of um thinking  
of maybe a scam but it was actually legit and 
it had four bedrooms and its own pool [Music]  
it was this was a one who watched the fire and 
catch up dance as the sunset and then ended the  
evening with dinner in a local restaurant having 
authentic local food and this cost this much  
right if so if we total it 
all up that comes to 891.20
not bad 676 dollars of that was spent on 
accommodation and I'm not surprised I did  
lash out in a lot of the places it was unnecessary 
to have my own private pool and if I wanted to  
dance again on that I could have easily spent 
only twenty to thirty dollars a night on very  
reasonable accommodation Transportation I paid 
42 dollars for which is absurd because I traveled  
throughout the south of Bali and food I spent 
63.70 on 60 is that right yeah that's right I  
spent 63 dollars in the whole week on food final 
categories Leisure which includes things like my  
laundry the massages that I had the activities 
I did the sightseeing and that totals up to 109  
so what is my verdict I could totally see why 
people work from Bali and why there are so many  
digital content creators that are based in Bali 
you get the best of everything you have beaches  
you have trailing you have good food and all for 
such a reasonable price I hope you enjoyed this  
video slightly different to my standard personal 
finance videos and if you enjoyed it then let me  
know I'll make more of these kind of videos 
for you guys thanks for watching see you soon"
6RHsmXWFCFk,"a good morning everyone in this video I will be 
taking you through a typical day of my life as an  
investment banker in London so I typically wake 
up between 6 and 6 30 a.m and the first thing I  
do is check my emails on my phone to make sure 
nothing has come through overnight and I'm not  
needed for any urgent calls today is looking okay 
so I have time for my morning routine as soon as  
my work day starts it catches up with me super 
quickly and leaves me with basically zero time  
to do anything else so I really try to make an 
active effort every morning to do some sort of  
exercise yes I then make a coffee and spend 10 
minutes just to write in my journal and outline  
my tasks for the day these are my personal tasks 
rather than work related and I usually write down  
every Sunday what I want to achieve from the 
week and the things I will do to get there I  
get ready have my breakfast which at the moment 
I'm exploring with a range of overnight oats and  
this one is mango and passion flavored and is 
absolutely Divine I flick through the main news  
for the day just to know what is going on in the 
market head and The Wider economy if I'm heading  
to the office I usually leave my house around 
7am followed by my least favorite part of the  
day and if you're a fellow Londoner you know very 
well about the dreaded morning commute right so  
before I dwell into what the rest of my day looks 
like I first wanted to share with you what working  
in an investment Bank actually involves on a more 
high level basis the common conception of a banker  
isn't always a positive one and I do believe this 
is exaggerated by the fact that many people don't  
actually understand what Bankers do and the value 
that investment banks have on the economy and it's  
quite difficult to explain what investment bankers 
do to people who aren't in the sector because  
there's no tangible product that people see at the 
end of it all but the services that Banks provide  
to companies are vital to the company's growth 
and ultimately the growth of the economy so the  
primary goal of an investment bank is to advise 
and help businesses on how to meet their financial  
challenges whether it's raising the capital they 
need raising the debt they need getting the loans  
they need or to buy and sell other companies if 
you remove the banking industry from the equation  
the economy just wouldn't move forward and a lot 
of companies would just collapse so I kick off my  
day at 8 A.M and as soon as I get on the desk the 
first thing I do is look through my calendar I'm  
someone who schedules pretty much everything 
into my calendar meetings replying to emails  
tasks absolutely everything so this also doubles 
up as a to-do list for me and Investment Banking  
it's very likely that you will get a whole load 
of tasks come at you bigger small coming at you  
throughout the day so having a clear to-do list 
and a schedule to see on top of your workload is  
super important we then kick off the day at 8 30 
a.m with a team call everyone gives a quick update  
on what deals they're looking at and we go through 
any market trends or drivers that anyone wants to  
share the interns and analysts would also be asked 
to get involved alternate and present during these  
meetings as well between 9 and 10 am I'm typically 
working on a proposal for a new client so I will  
have a call and bring in an associate to brief 
them on the New Deal that they'll be working  
with me on so the type of deals that a banker 
looks at largely depends on what type of Bank  
they are and what part of the bank they work in 
so if you look at a startup company that was to  
fund its gross Journey this can be done either 
through the debt market so that means raising  
money through loans and bonds which banks will 
help them through all through the equity market  
so being publicly listed which will raise a whole 
amount of capital for the company even after going  
down either of these Avenues or a combination 
of both a company might want to acquire another  
company or buy another company they think okay I 
can I can buy that company I could turn it around  
and ultimately then get even bigger and increase 
my market share which will then further help my  
growth and so again banks are there to help them 
at this stage as well so really different areas of  
the bank are present at almost every stage of 
a company's growth journey to help in so many  
aspects which otherwise wouldn't be possible I 
work on the debt side so essentially what this  
means is helping companies and governments 
raise money to fund their growth Journey  
whether it's Acquisitions capital expenditure 
or broadly anything that the company needs debt  
financing for to help them grow and ultimately 
their growth will then feedback straight into  
the economy so our goal is to provide solutions 
for these clients and understand how we can help  
them overcome any Financial challenges so when it 
comes to briefing an associate I usually give them  
an overview on the new deal I'll go through what 
work and research they can start doing and also  
start working on other elements myself in parallel 
so to kind of put this in context when it comes  
to the corporate team structure there's typically 
four five six people in each team with a managing  
director at the top that is executive director 
then a VP and then an associate and an analyst  
so as an analyst you don't have anyone reporting 
to you as an analyst you'll be doing the let's  
say basic work that will then be reviewed by the 
associate and fed back for any corrections this  
would then go to the VP to analyze and highlight 
any corrections and then I'll be signed off by the  
MD so these Corrections can include things like 
okay can you format this slightly differently or  
can you show this information using a pie chart 
instead of a column chart or maybe just to double  
check a number and finally this will get signed 
off by the MD these presentations would typically  
be used for client meetings and would be used to 
present complex information in a more simplified  
manner to a client this is just one part of 
my to-do list for the morning there would be  
a number of ad hoc tasks and jobs to do at the 
same time and usually I'd pull in an analyst or  
associate to help support me on those between 
10 and 12 I would be on a number of calls and  
meetings so during these meetings we will discuss 
the best way to serve the client and what we can  
offer them one of the best things about working 
in an investment bank is that no two days will  
be the same you can't expect or predict your 
workload you can't predict when a new deal  
will come across your desk you can't predict what 
kind of projects you'll be working on so it keeps  
things unpredictable and very exciting between 
12 and 1 I'd usually have lunch the length of  
my lunch really depends on my workload for the 
day sometimes I have excellent lunches meet up  
with another client meet up with another bank I 
usually have this about once a week between 1 and  
3 pm there would be an internal meeting on another 
live deal which is basically a deal that we are  
working on for our client so depending on where 
you sit within a bank you'll likely see different  
parts of the still so the credit team will see 
the deal from one aspect the rest team will see  
it from another aspect the legal team checks the 
documentation and the terms and the front office  
team takes on The View on how to best serve the 
client there are a lot of different divisions  
within a bank that all work interchangeably and do 
different things so if working for a corporation  
or working for someone is something that is for 
you then it's very likely there is an area of an  
investment bank that has elements of the role 
that will align who you are with what you do  
between three to five PM there could be a client 
meeting this would generally be an update called  
checking in with a client asking if they had any 
questions on the proposal we sent to them when  
it comes to typical hours in Investment Banking 
you can expect to work 12 13 14 plus hours a day  
but this really depends on the division you're in 
and your seniority if you are in the front office  
working in markets for example you will start your 
day when markets open which is a lot earlier than  
middle office or back office which faces off to 
other divisions within the bank when it comes to  
how much you need to be available I'm pretty much 
available 21 seven and I've got my work phone on  
me all the time including when I'm on holidays 
you've kind of just are expected to check in  
every now and then around 5pm I need a pick-me-up 
and grab a coffee with someone there is a massive  
Coffee Culture in Investment Banking especially in 
the early years of your career I always encourage  
analysts and Associates to go on as many coffee 
catch-ups as possible it's super important to  
network and get to know people both in your 
team and outside of your team because Making  
Connections is one of the key ways to build your 
brand and navigate your career in the future so  
after 5 30 PM all the key internal and external 
meetings would usually be done for the day and  
after this time I do a bit more preparing for 
other meetings or work with the associates to  
update Market slides or something like that I 
usually have a few more phone calls to make and  
I near the end of my day as an investment banker 
I try to squeeze in at least an hour or so after  
I've cooked dinner to work on my YouTube channel 
because that really is the thing that brings me  
the most happiness so thanks so much for watching

Wm-osUs71p4,"hi guys in this video i'm going to
talking about the single easiest passive
income stream out there and that is high
interest rate savings accounts
last month i made 200 pounds from my
high interest rate savings accounts
which literally took me less than five
minutes to set up in this video i'm
going to be diving into what they are
why you should use them and which ones i
currently use high interest rate savings
account is my favorite type of passive
income because it requires the least
work to set up so firstly what is
passive income passive income is money
that is not directly tied to your time
for example if you write a book you
putting all that work in up front to
publish that book and then every time it
sells you earn money from royalties this
is in contrast to active income which
requires your time and effort to be able
to earn money like a nine to five
corporate job say you have ten thousand
pounds saved in a traditional savings
account at 0.1 interest then after one
year you would have earned 10 pounds now
say you decide to open up and save that
10 000 pounds in a high interest rate
savings account at 2 interest then after
1 year you would have made 200 pounds
all from just taking out five minutes to
set up your account so why should you
use it first it's completely risk-free
so if you put your money into a bank or
an account that's regulated by the
financial conducts authority that means
your money up to 85 000 pounds is
protected so if anything happens to that
bank or provider and it goes fast then
the government will just step in and
make sure you get your money back
the second thing is the interest you
earn after a certain amount is
completely tax free so if you're a basic
rate taxpayer earning anything up to 50
000 pounds then the interest you earn up
to 1 000 pounds is completely tax free
if you're a higher rate taxpayer only
between 50 000 and 150 000 pounds then
the interest you earn up to 500 pounds
is completely tax free and then you also
have something called cash i says which
is a cash individual savings account and
you're able to put in 20 000 pounds in
there every year and any interest you
earn on that 20 000 pounds is completely
tax free regardless of your personal
income the final reason to put your
money into a high interest rate savings
account is because it offsets the impact
of inflation so inflation is currently
around the two 2.5 mark which
essentially means that stuff costs two
percent more than it did the year before
if you put your money into a traditional
savings account at 0.1 interest then
your money is going to be worth less and
less over time and you'll be losing out
to inflation so by taking out five
minutes to set up a high interest rate
savings account you're protecting your
money and offsetting them out that your
money is losing out to inflation before
we go into how which high interest rate
savings account is the best one for you
i'm nisha i'm a chartered accountant and
i love all things property and finance i
make weekly videos on how to make more
money and save more money so if that's
for you then please just subscribe there
are four types of high interest rate
savings account and the best one for you
really depends on your situation as a
rule of thumb the longer you lock your
money in for the higher the rate you're
going to get first you have easy access
savings account and these are currently
paying around the 0.6 mark these are
especially useful if you're saving for
something in the short term maybe for a
holiday or for a big present for easy
access savings accounts you'll be paid
monthly rather than annually so even if
you're saving for a short term your
money will still grow then you have
notice savings accounts and this is when
the bank provider usually requires you
to give them advanced notice before you
withdraw your money this is usually
around 30 days and in return you'll be
rewarded with higher interest rates
currently notice savers accounts are
paying around the 1.1 mark then you have
fixed rate savings accounts these are
especially useful if you have a big
purchase coming up maybe you're looking
to buy a house or buy a car or you're
saving up for a wedding and you have
money set aside that you don't want to
put in stocks and shares in case it
loses value by the time you need to
access it fixed rate options are
currently paying around the two percent
mark so it makes sense to put your money
into a fixed rate option until you're
going to need to use that money
and then you have cash license which i
mentioned earlier these are also useful
if you're looking to save for the long
run they can be fixed rate or easy
access savings account and they're
currently paying around the 1.5
what i do is i put some of my emergency
funds and the next three to six months
of expenses into an easy access savings
account which i can tap into at any time
and then i put some of my cash into a
fixed rate option where i can lock in
those higher rates today
there are three main things you need to
look out for when you're picking out the
best high interest rate account for you
first it's the interest rate
don't necessarily go for the highest
paying interest rate there may be some
other fees that are associated with it
so you're ideally looking for one that
has zero maintenance fees there are also
banks and providers that provide you
with a high interest rate to start off
with as an incentive and then reduces
below the average after a certain amount
of time so ideally you're looking for
one with a
long high interest rate period and also
one with zero fees
the second thing you need to look out
for is the amount that you could earn
the money on usually there's a cap
amount so you could earn for example 1.5
or 2 interest on your savings up to 2
000 pounds if you have savings above
that 2 000 pounds it makes sense for you
to open up another bank account for your
savings above that 2 000 pounds so you
can maximize the interest you are able
to earn the final point is to make sure
that that bank or provider is fca
regulated so if anything happens or if
that bank or provider goes bus you can
ensure that your money is protected
personally i use markers by goldman's
and i've been using them for a couple of
years now the platform is really easy to
use the customer service is great but
they have slashed their interest rates
and they are no longer the highest
paying there are higher paying ones in
the uk uh nationwide flex claro and
virgin are some of the few also put some
of my money into high interest rate
savings accounts i also like to take a
bit more risk for my money and seek
higher rewards and so i've also invested
my money into accounts linked to the
stock market
this is especially useful if you're not
looking to touch that money for the next
five years and i'll be making a video on
that more specifically but for those of
you that may need the funds in the short
term then high interest rate savings
accounts are a great way to go in the
short term"
7881CYOdA28,"welcome to my first video on property
for beginners in this video i'm going to
be covering the best property strategy
for beginners how to finance your
property deal and what kind of returns
you should be expecting
if you've already started researching on
how to start a property you've probably
heard of the brewer method being thrown
around a lot
it stands for buy renovate rent
refinance and repeat
so what does this mean and how can you
actually apply it first up it's buy
you're not looking to buy modern
properties or newborn properties you're
looking to buy older properties run down
properties dilapidated properties and
properties that are kind of in need for
some modernization and some tlc you then
look to add value to the property which
then in turn increases the price you
could sell the property at so how do we
add value this brings us on to the first
r which is renovate
there are a couple of different ways
which you can renovate a property i'm
going to cover the four main ways
i've done all of these but it really
depends on your own preference and kind
of boils down to two main things which
is a your budget and b your time so one
of the main ways to renovate a property
is just by fixing what's broken
which is kind of a simple repair
renovation technique so whether it's a
heating that needs to be fixed maybe
it's a new electric fuse box maybe
there's some
dodgy windows that could do with a
double glazing
it's essentially just doing the bare
minimum that puts your property into a
place where you can rent it out the
second renovation technique is what i
like to call cosmetics so it's how the
property looks from the outside walking
in towards the property and also how it
looks from the inside as a first
impression to a potential buyer so this
includes like a new paint new carpet and
maybe there's quite an outdated kitchen
which could do with some modernization
or maybe there's an old-fashioned
bathroom which could do with a complete
revamp it's all about how the property
looks and feels the third renovation
technique is a spatial improvement and
this is essentially playing around with
the existing layout of the property so
the existing envelope for the property
in a way that maximizes the rent you
could achieve from it so maybe there's a
separate kitchen and a lounge and you
could break down the wall in between to
give it more of an open space feel or
maybe there's two reception rooms and
you convert one of the reception rooms
into a bedroom
another common one that i do is when
there's a really big master bedroom with
two windows you can put a partition wall
in between and split it up into two
single bedrooms which in turn increases
the rent you can get from the property
the fourth and final way
and probably the most expensive and
time-consuming way is increasing the
floor space of the property so this
could be via an extension
at the back or adding in a conservatory
or maybe there's a loft that you can
build into and convert that into another
bedroom the two that i'll be focusing
mostly on in 2022 is the first two so
repairing what's broken and cosmetics
especially with the shortage in builders
at the moment and the extended delivery
time frames and this is a quick way to
go into a project do it up uplift the
value and pull your money out and move
on to your next one once you've
renovated your property in a way which
you could get the maximum rent from it
you then look to refinance the property
refinancing in this context is when you
get a new loan on the uplifted value of
the property so after you've done all
your renovation works to replace the
existing loan which you took out to buy
the property in the first place there's
a couple of different ways that you can
buy a property and i'll be going into
those financing methods in another video
but for the purposes of this i'm just
going to be sticking to the refinancing
element so the loan you get on a buy to
let property is roughly capped around 75
of the property price
so say you bought a property for 100 000
and you take out a buy to let loan
you're going to get about 75 000 pounds
in terms of the loan value and the
remaining 25 000 you'd have to put in it
as cash
once you've uplifted the value of the
property your new loan would be 75
on the uplifted value
so say after the works your property
price is 150 000 then your loan value
will be 75 of 150 000 which is 112 500.
so the idea here is to uplift the value
refinance and pull all your money out
including the refurbishment costs that
you've put into the property
and then move on to your next project
you'd still have on the side a
cash generating asset and which will
give you a rental income
kind of a passive income going forward
the final r is repeat every time you
take the money out of the deal you then
put it into a new one and you repeat the
process over and over and over again as
a rough rule of thumb for my projects i
usually budget around 10 of the property
price towards the refurbishment costs
the second thing i'll budget for is the
hidden cost so around five percent of
the property price i would factor in for
the surveyor cost the solicitor fees the
stamp duties um and i'll put these on
i'll take these all into account when
doing my deal analysis so the ideal deal
you want to get all of your money out
so you'd look to buy a property at
around 30 to 35 below market value to be
able to do that
for the projects that i've done i
usually see myself having about five to
ten percent of my money left in and then
i just refinance it take it out and then
move on to the next project there's
loads more to say about investing in
property but if you're new to the game
then the burke method is a great way to
get started it's also a lot less risk
than some of the more complex stuff
which requires planning permission or
new build developments so hopefully that
was helpful i'll be covering more
property and finance related stuff in
future videos so stay tuned"
