# Sentiment-Driven Video Recommendations
Personalized video recommendation system based on video content, user interactions, and sentiment analysis from comments to recommend relevant videos to users.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            
**Input:**
- `video_id`: The unique identifier of the video for which recommendations are being generated.
- `title`: The title of the video for which recommendations are being generated.

**Output:**

|    | video_id    | title                                                                                               |   final_score |\n|---:|:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------:|\n|  0 | -bu9x-UT0yk | Jasmy Technologies is Shaping Japanâ€™s Future with AI, Robotics, and IoT                             |      0.501651 |\n|  2 | FKN5DSKzCPc | KoiBot 2nd Gen AI Commercial Robot:  Introducing remote healthcare applications with JAG Technology |      0.42254  |\n|  5 | 9LFbMz7DrDA | Artificial Intelligence -powered Phone Banking Solution for Financial Institutions                  |      0.408975 |\n|  7 | YT-lPqYbv9k | Case Studies of Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, Social Equity and Bias                             |      0.400314 |\n|  9 | eDbaDbvCsg8 | Medical AI: Exploring  the Realm  Prof   John Doyle                                                 |      0.390431 |

**Workflow:**
1. **Input:** The system takes a `video_id` and its corresponding `title` as input.
2. **Processing:** Based on the input video, the system processes the data to identify the most relevant videos.
3. **Output:** The system outputs a DataFrame (`df`) with the top 10 recommended videos, sorted by their `final_score`.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recommendations based on:

- **Video Content**: creating a similarity cousine matrix from the video transcripts.
- **Comments Sentiment Analysis**: extracting the sentiments of each video for more personalized recommendations.
- **Clustering**: clustering similar videos based on their figures  and applying these clusters in the recommendation process.

## Key Features

### 1. Content-Based Filtering:
- Built a TF-IDF matrix from video transcriptions.

$$
\text{TF}(t, d) = \frac{\text{Number of times term } t \text{ appears in document } d}{\text{Total number of terms in document } d}
$$

$$
\text{IDF}(t) = \log\left(\frac{N}{|\{d \in D : t \in d\}|}\right)
$$

$$
\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t)
$$

- Applied cosine similarity to identify similar videos.

### 2. Sentiment-Weighted Recommendations:
- Incorporated sentiment analysis to refine similarity scores.
- Integrated video statistics (view count, like count, comment count) into the final recommendation score.

### 3. Clustering:
- Applied DBSCAN for clustering videos based on their features.
- Prioritized videos from the same cluster in the recommendation process.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Preparation:
- Cleaned and standardized video and comment data.
- Applied sentiment analysis.
- Engineered relevant features.

### 2. Recommendation Generation:
- Generated recommendations using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
- Adjusted recommendations based on sentiment and video statistics.
- Boosted recommendations from the same cluster and ensured language consistency.

### 3. Evaluation:
- Used Precision@K, Recall@K, and F1-Score to evaluate recommendation quality.
- Applied the Silhouette Score for cluster validation.

### Data
## Datasets from Youtube API
Decided to do a research through the API with 5 queries about 'Artificial Intelligence':

- "What is artificial intelligence?"
- "Artificial intelligence applications in healthcare"
- "AI in autonomous vehicles"
- "Machine learning vs deep learning"
- "Artificial intelligence in finance"
- "How does AI work?"
- "Top AI tools for data science"
- "Artificial intelligence in robotics"

The following datasets were gathered:

- **`df_videos`**: Video data including view count, like count, comment count, and more.
  
- **`df_comments`**: Comment data with sentiment analysis and engagement metrics.

- **`df_channels`**: Channel-level data including subscriber count and total video views.
  
- **`df_categories`**: Categorical data related to video genres and types.
