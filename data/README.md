trade, attempting to swap hats, balls and books, each of which were given a certain value.

The goal is to provide an introduction to the range of practical engineering problems that deep learning is well suited for, and explain why it can solve these problems when traditional methods fall short; either by being inefficient, inaccurate, or impractical.

But since the retiree began treatment at the AKH Vienna, he is hoping that it might be possible to halt the progression of his illness.                   |                      |                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |              |             |             |                |            |            |           |            |\n|    |             |                                                                                                      |                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                      |                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |              |             |             |                |            |            |           |            |\n|    |             |                                                                                                      |                          | Computer science experts and medics are also working together to help the Essen University Hospital go digital. Dr. Felix Nensa and Professor Arzu Oezcelik are improving care for transplant patients with the help of artificial intelligence. AI can calculate the size of organs, like the liver, for example, much more precisely and more quickly than people - and thereby improve outcomes and the safety of the procedure.
