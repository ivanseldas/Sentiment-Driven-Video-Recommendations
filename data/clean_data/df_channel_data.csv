I try to take a diverse approach to the content I create:
- Short videos that teach one specific concept.
- Tutorials that show what is possible with various python packages or machine learning models.
- Live coding streams where the topics are driven by the chat and community.

Floyd is a small robot with a big personality and an IQ around 155. He can talk for hours on virtually any topic, in 50 different languages. Onboard, Floyd runs a Raspberry Pi 4B, which connects to OpenAI for his speech abilities.

Prior to this build I had never written any Python in my life, but I used ChatGPT as an assistant / tutor and that accelerated my learning curve by probably about 5x.

Chassis & Arm: Hiwonder.com
USB Microphone & Speaker: Adafruit.com
Inspiration: DevMiser's ""DaVinci"" project

Initially, this project cost about $400 and took up a good portion of my spare time over like 3 months.

Our goals are to see what's involved in building a fully conversational bot, see how people respond to it, and to continue adding features like visual image recognition, more memory, etc. Please share your thoughts and ideas in the comments!

Here, we talk about, freelancing and working from home, about career, success and happiness, about personal development and success habits, about work life balance and working from home.

No one ever tells you that having a fulfilling life is easy. In fact, we are taught from young ages all about stereotypes: I will be happy when I have a family, a house with a picket fence, a car, a highly paid job or a successful business. We are conditioned to believe that happiness is a milestone, a point that you need to reach and THEN you can be happy.

But when you are dreaming of a future different than the one you are living, I believe it is our job to pursue it and do everything you can to create it. And if you are mindful, ambitious, and visionary, with the right intentions, ANYTHING is possible.

Let's do this!

Ethical Implications of AI SS2020

Course Description

AI is becoming a sophisticated tool in the hands of a variety of stakeholders, including political leaders. Some AI applications may raise new ethical and legal questions, and in general have a significant impact on society (for the good or for the bad or for both). 

People’s motivation plays a key role here. With AI the important question is how to avoid that it goes out of control, and how to understand how decisions are made and what are the consequences for society at large. 

Students will learn the ethical implications of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

What are the consequences for society? For human beings / individuals?  Does AI serve human kind?

I don't do sponsored projects, I don't do early seed deals. Instead 100% of my focus is on the liquid crypto markets that everyone else trades on.

Last cycle I turned a little bit of money into a life changing amount of money. I held onto that money during the bear market and  went all in less than a week from the exact bottom of the market.

This cycle my goal is to hit 3 different milestones:

1000% Gain for my overall crypto portfolio

5000% Gain for my overall crypto portfolio

10,000% Gain for my overall crypto portfolio

UCY3K5KpHpALhyLml3RhF65A,Bala Latha Madam,"If you can dream it, 
you can do it.
If I can do it, anyone can do it.

Many people pose a question?
How? How it is possible to achieve challenging things? 

A simple answer is, 

Question the purpose, trust yourself, and the process which you undergo, and create your own destiny.

Failures are true opportunities to make you more stronger and capable. Don't stop by facing hurdles, they are just like passing clouds but you are the sky. Living in the present and hoping for the future is better than regretting the past which is a fallen leaf. You are insulting yourself if you compare your unique value with others, know yourself, and your abilities. 

Don't be so serious about life but be sincere and grab success.
ALL THE BEST

Yours 
Bala Latha Madam

•	Thorough explanations of each line of code in the video
•	Detailed annotations for each line of code in the file
